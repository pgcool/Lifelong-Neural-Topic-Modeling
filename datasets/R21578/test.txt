trade	ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT   Mounting trade friction between the   U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting   nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic   damage, businessmen and officials said.       They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.   Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the   U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.       But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt   them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be   their gain.       The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on   imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in   retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not   to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.       Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs   at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms   said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the   new taxes.       "We wouldn't be able to do business," said a spokesman for   leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric   Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.       "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time   beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of   exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.," said Tom   Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James   Capel and Co>.       In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.       "We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against   Japan because it serves as a warning to us," said a senior   Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.       Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last   year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.       The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves   to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.       "We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and   cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we   want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation," said   Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.       A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion   association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan   might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports   are similar to those of Japan.       Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion   dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.       In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough   curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of   semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the   U.S.       In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been   selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics   manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such   a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by   further U.S. Pressure to block imports.       "That is a very short-term view," said Lawrence Mills,   director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.       "If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will   be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong   is the disadvantage of action restraining trade," he said.       The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,   accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.       The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade   talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,   Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.       "This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two   countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very   serious matter," Button said.       He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,   Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant   U.S. Exports to that country.       Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the   trade stand-off continue.       Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined   a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.       The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget   and record public works spending in the first half of the   financial year.       They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency   measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister   Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.       Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto   Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and   Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an   effort to end the dispute.
grain	CHINA DAILY SAYS VERMIN EAT 7-12 PCT GRAIN STOCKS   A survey of 19 provinces and seven cities   showed vermin consume between seven and 12 pct of China's grain   stocks, the China Daily said.       It also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes, or 25 pct, of   China's fruit output are left to rot, and 2.1 mln tonnes, or up   to 30 pct, of its vegetables. The paper blamed the waste on   inadequate storage and bad preservation methods.       It said the government had launched a national programme to   reduce waste, calling for improved technology in storage and   preservation, and greater production of additives. The paper   gave no further details.
crude:nat-gas	JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS   The Ministry of International Trade and   Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand   outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese   energy demand, ministry officials said.       MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy   supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600   mln, they said.       The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in   Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen   and a decline in domestic electric power demand.       MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand   outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the   Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.       They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy   supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.       Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power   in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27   pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and   liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.
corn:grain:rice:rubber:sugar:tin:trade	THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER   Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5   billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a   year ago, the Business Economics Department said.       It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht   from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this   year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials   and semi-finished products.       The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the   first quarter due to lower oil prices.       The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6   billion baht from 56.6 billion.       Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower   earnings from many key commodities including rice whose   earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26   pct and canned pineapples seven pct.       Products registering high export growth were jewellery up   64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.
palm-oil:veg-oil	INDONESIA SEES CPO PRICE RISING SHARPLY   Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)   prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB   sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall   in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree   crops, told Indonesian reporters.       Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332   dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.       Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite   making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it   could possibly increase its international market share.       Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil   after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure   supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.       Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary   shortage than to lose export markets.       Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500   tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank   figures.
ship	AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT   Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),   Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on   foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still   being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.       The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented   the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.       The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration   Commission today.       Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the   ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.       The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week   of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to   protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.       The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to   be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of   each shift and then to walk off.       Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with   container movements most affected, but has not stopped   altogether, they said.       They said they could not say how long the disruption will   go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.
coffee:lumber:palm-oil:rubber:veg-oil	INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND   The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is   likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and   possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian   Nainggolan said.       He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in   palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.       Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil   may also be introduced. But he said the question was still   being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no   decision on when to go ahead had been made.       The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber   physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.       "Several factors make us move cautiously," Nainggolan said.   "We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a   mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange."       Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee   added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to   five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are   traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,   exchange officials said.       The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the   introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one   official said a feasibility study was needed first. No   decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April   23, traders said.       Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the   world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should   expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of   the exchange would help this.       Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost   overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.       He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to   encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would   also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to   encourage participation.       Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start   although trading in coffee has been disappointing.       Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in   April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9   mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered   locally, the latest exchange report said.        Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905   tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.        Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and   44 traders.
grain:wheat	SRI LANKA GETS USDA APPROVAL FOR WHEAT PRICE   Food Department officials said the U.S.   Department of Agriculture approved the Continental Grain Co   sale of 52,500 tonnes of soft wheat at 89 U.S. Dlrs a tonne C   and F from Pacific Northwest to Colombo.       They said the shipment was for April 8 to 20 delivery.
gold	WESTERN MINING TO OPEN NEW GOLD MINE IN AUSTRALIA   Western Mining Corp Holdings Ltd   &lt;WMNG.S> (WMC) said it will establish a new joint venture gold   mine in the Northern Territory at a cost of about 21 mln dlrs.       The mine, to be known as the Goodall project, will be owned   60 pct by WMC and 40 pct by a local W.R. Grace and Co &lt;GRA>   unit. It is located 30 kms east of the Adelaide River at Mt.   Bundey, WMC said in a statement       It said the open-pit mine, with a conventional leach   treatment plant, is expected to produce about 50,000 ounces of   gold in its first year of production from mid-1988. Annual ore   capacity will be about 750,000 tonnes.
acq	SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER   Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to   lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of   its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.       Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9   trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank   with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in   October.       But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu   told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its   position.       "We'll be back in position in first place within three   years," Komatsu said in an interview.       He said that while the merger will initially reduce   Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand   Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where   it has been relatively weak.       But financial analysts are divided on whether and how   quickly the gamble will pay off.       Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in   view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger   was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch   network from scratch.       The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has   expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business   and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the   wisdom of some of those moves.       "They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now   it's largely out of their hands," said Kleinwort Benson Ltd   financial analyst Simon Smithson.       Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to   enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American   investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.       Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5   pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at   least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange   personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.       "The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the   Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected," said one analyst.       But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.       "U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,   we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three   years, not until the 21st century," Komatsu said.       Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes   into the securities business at home.       Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's   version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial   from investment banking.       But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu   said he hopes further deregulation will create new   opportunities.       "We need to find new business chances," Komatsu said. "In some   cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust   bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."       Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such   domestic securities business as profitable government bond   dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co   Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.       He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering   the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank   subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.        The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to   securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,   following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European   universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.       But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar   decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.       "We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed   in two or three years," he said.       Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand   lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to   replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.       The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of   time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the   merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.       "It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies," said   Kleinwort's Smithson.       "After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling   around. It will be the next decade before we see if the   strategy is right or wrong."
tin	SUBROTO SAYS INDONESIA SUPPORTS TIN PACT EXTENSION   Mines and Energy Minister Subroto   confirmed Indonesian support for an extension of the sixth   International Tin Agreement (ITA), but said a new pact was not   necessary.       Asked by Reuters to clarify his statement on Monday in   which he said the pact should be allowed to lapse, Subroto said   Indonesia was ready to back extension of the ITA.       "We can support extension of the sixth agreement," he said.   "But a seventh accord we believe to be unnecessary."       The sixth ITA will expire at the end of June unless a   two-thirds majority of members vote for an extension.
interest:money-fx	BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.1 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER   The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1   billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities   repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank   spokesman said.       Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,   will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy   back securities pledged on May 6.       Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as   an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively   withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with   today's allocation.       A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the   withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit   policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful   liquidity in the banking system.       Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank   over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely   April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.       The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2   billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks   themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.       Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much   liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the   effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main   open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two   further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.       The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6   and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that   range are possible, dealers said.
acq:copper	BOND CORP STILL CONSIDERING ATLAS MINING BAIL-OUT   Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S> and Atlas   Consolidated Mining and Development Corp &lt;ATLC.MN> are still   holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining   firm, an Atlas statement said.       Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it   had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a   net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,   compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.       The company said it had been able to cut its losses because   its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu   started in the second half of 1986.       Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition   by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their   restructuring into a gold loan.       A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in   October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of   275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.       Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity   infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for   further exploration and development of the company's gold   properties in the central province of Masbate.       Wilson Banks, general manager of &lt;Bond Corp International   Ltd> in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the   negotiations was "reasonably accurate."       Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several   investments in the Philippines but did not give details.       In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World   War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and   the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life   at least until 1993.
ipi	CHINA INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES IN FIRST QUARTER   China's industrial output rose 14.1 pct   in the first quarter of 1987 against the same 1986 period, the   People's Daily said.       Its overseas edition said the growth rate, which compares   with a target of seven pct for the whole of 1987, was "rather   high" but the base in the first quarter of 1986 was on the low   side. Industrial output grew 4.4 pct in the first quarter of   1986.       It said China's industrial production this year has been   normal but product quality and efficiency need further   improvement. It gave no further details.
carcass:corn:grain:livestock:oilseed:rice:soybean:trade	JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.   Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by   U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will   tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that   liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,   a senior ministry official said.       "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives   by other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,   said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and   it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise   its farm import market," he said.       Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.   Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open   its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to   protect local farmers.       Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat   exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.   End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.       U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to   visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask   Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and   remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.       Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market   share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has   been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year   beef accord next March 31.       Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales   from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports   from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although   the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.       U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its   beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain   imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.       An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when   Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has   the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.   Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing   some one billion dlrs in new business.       The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs   and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import   controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,   purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,   prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.       To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's   top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove   residual import restrictions on agricultural products.       But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional   reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue   should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the   industrial sector.       "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these   issues should not be discussed on the same table," the official   said.

Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing   in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain   some 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will   remove around 194 mln. In addition, a rise in note circulation   and bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110   mln stg.       Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions   will add some 690 mln stg to the system today.
bop:trade	SOUTH KOREA MOVES TO SLOW GROWTH OF TRADE SURPLUS   South Korea's trade surplus is growing too   fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it   down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.       He told a press conference the government planned to   increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market   to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold   the surplus "at a proper level."       But he said the government would not allow the won to   appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has   been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.       The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with   the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3   billion dlrs in 1985.       Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects   were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government   would try to hold the current account surplus to around five   billion dlrs a year for the next five years.       "Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five   billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in   exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now   the surplus is growing faster than we expected," he said.       Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35   pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this   year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.       Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a   surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr   deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the   country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first   time.       South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs   in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest   in Asia.       "This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the   major constraints on our development... Last year was a major   turning point for the Korean economy," Kim said.       Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of   foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from   about 50 pct in 1986.       "The government, however, does not want to accelerate   reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus," he   said.       Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation   and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,   particularly the United States.       "We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but   we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a   proper level," Kim said.
gas:lead	FINNS AND CANADIANS TO STUDY MTBE PRODUCTION PLANT   Finland's national oil company Neste Oy   &lt;NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms   to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,   Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.       The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln   Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether   (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.       The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada   Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line   Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.       The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials   availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the   important capital and operating advantages gained by locating   on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.       The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant   producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer   that can replace tetra ethyl lead.       Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States   where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of   health concerns, the statement added.       Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the   U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in   Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,   it said.       Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five   billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a   major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.       The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on   stream in late 1989, the statement said.

A DIW report added the general downturn in the economy   since last Autumn had had a negative effect on the willingness   of firms to take on workers. It referred to a marked downturn   in the number of workers taken on in the capital goods sector.

earn	CITIBANK NORWAY UNIT LOSES SIX MLN CROWNS IN 1986   Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N>, the Norwegian   subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of   just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers   said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.       Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told   Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries   operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for   investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic   slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.       Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in   Norway since 1985.       Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's   second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved   later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would   make profit this year.       Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but   Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned   liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a   steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.       Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's &lt;CMB.N>   subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy   losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.

trade	JAPAN GIVEN LITTLE HOPE OF AVOIDING U.S. SANCTIONS   A top U.S. Official said Japan has little   chance of convincing the U.S. To drop threatened trade   sanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for   Washington today.       Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political   Affairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan's moves   to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could   persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports   said, and replied: "...It is probably too early for the figures   to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to   permit the result you have described."       Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift   its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove   barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.       "There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,   but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from   important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on   security and political issues," he said.       "The question is whether through cooperative actions between   our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether   Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist   legislation," he said.
zinc	THAI ZINC EXPORTS FALL IN MARCH   Thai zinc ingot exports fell to 882   tonnes in March from 1,764 in February and 3,008 in March 1986,   the Mineral Resources Department said.       A spokesman for Padaeng Industry Co Ltd, the country's sole   exporter, attributed the decline to the company's lower stocks,   which averaged 5,000 tonnes in the first quarter against 16,000   tonnes in late 1985 when it began exporting.       The department said major buyers included China, Japan, the   Philippines, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.       Thailand exported 4,842 tonnes of zinc ingots during the   first quarter, down from 14,937 a year ago.
sugar	EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO PREDICT - LONDON TRADE   The outcome of today's European Community   (EC) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after   last week's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest   ever rebate of 46.864 European currency units (Ecus) per 100   kilos, traders said.       Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be   smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view   on the likely restitution. Last week, the European Commission   accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators   protesting about low rebates. This might be a determining   factor in today's result, they added.

He did not disclose the offered price.       Diaz said Australian brewer Alan Bond's Bond Corp Holdings   Ltd had offered 150 pesos per share for the "B" shares.       Diaz said New York investment bank Allen and Co Inc had   earlier said it was interested in buying all 38.1 mln   sequestered shares. He told Reuters last month Elders IXL Ltd   &lt;ELXA.S>, the Melbourne-based brewing company, had also bid for   the "B" shares.       The Hong Kong Economic Journal last month quoted a   spokesman of Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying   that &lt;Barwon Farmlands Ltd>, an Australian firm owned 30 pct by   &lt;Ariadne Australia Ltd>, was planning a Filipino branch in   order to buy the entire block of 38.1 mln shares.

interest:money-fx	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING   Australian markets are booming as foreign   fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and   other traditional markets, analysts said.       High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and   an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of   fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and   U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.       Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in   and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they   diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.       A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in   the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the   currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.       Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital   are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily   inquiries from Japan and the United States.       "These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about   and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending   up here with the attraction of high interest rates and   reasonable currency stability," National Australia Bank Ltd   economist Brian Hamley said.       "There is a 'flight to quality'," Hamley said. "Australia may   not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too   many other countries where you'd want to put your money."       The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting   investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against   the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.       "We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.   Where some people would be concerned about the value of the   U.S. Dollar," Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose   said. "Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap   and the currency looks stable?"       But turning that capital into more permanent productive   investment depends on government economic policy, he said.       "It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the   direction in the economy," Buttrose said, adding that offshore   investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough   economic statement on May 14.       While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding   interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as   easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were   badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar   and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.       "It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be   delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one   might see a substantial outflow," Buttrose said.       Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough   economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and   stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.       "They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think   they would like to leave the money here," Buttrose said.       Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased   interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield   Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.       Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an   element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency   policy when he said authorities could not take their "eyes off   the yen" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.       Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked   successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar   within the range of 100 to 103 yen.       Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the   Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a   trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.       Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming   Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other   markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the   weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into   equities, particularly in the gold sector.       The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3   today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while   the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the   same period.       The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese   companies that have invested heavily in the United States in   recent years turning their attention to undervalued real   estate, particularly in the tourism field.       Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star   Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs   as indicative of the type of property being sought.       "They think they find good value real estate here which,   with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of   investment Australia needs," Buttrose added.
cpi:gnp	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY   Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden   economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices   will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists   say.       Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold   oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the   northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.       Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross   domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year   after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.       This was after taking into account inflation in consumer   prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.       Factors depressing economic activity include the   6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which   threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the   Gulf and has sapped business confidence.       But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September   when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis   caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive   new debt settlement program was introduced.       The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward   trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.       The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer   spending, thus generating an informal credit system.       Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are   still owed by individuals and companies.       There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)   in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which   one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as   bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it   will not allow any banks to go under.       The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of   problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether   debtors have regular cash flows or not.       Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights   guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance   in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector   is the biggest after oil.       Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride   out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.       Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)   compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last   year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.       But strategic diversification into downstream operations in   Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at   home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell   over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.       Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average   2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed   product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as   crude.       Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason   for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic   inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent   years and signs government spending on productive sectors will   remain steady.       External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8   billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below   that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit   Gulf.       Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put   officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income   of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.       But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these   reserves may not be enough to prevent a "real" budget deficit for   the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.       In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,   revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,   doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.       This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded   in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at   up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some   shortfall.       Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for   economic growth this year or next.       "It depends on oil prices," one said. "This summer is   important."       Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday   the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state   spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the   economy.       He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be   spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.
oilseed:palm-oil:soy-oil:soybean:veg-oil	MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET   Malaysia is unlikely to meet its   targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar   1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.       Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,   unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser   and overstressed palms, they said.       The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World   newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to   drop sharply this year.       Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about   115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more   palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the   industry, a leading grower told Reuters.       The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes   against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.       The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year   due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.       The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,   is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous   21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.       In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected   to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil   output peaks.       They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,   with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees   against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction   will not be felt for about another three years.

trade	JAPANESE OFFICIAL TAKES DATA TO MICROCHIP TALKS   Ministry of International Trade and   Industry (MITI) Vice Minister Makoto Kuroda leaves for   Washington today with data he hopes will refute U.S. Charges   Japan has violated a pact on microchip trade.       A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington   laying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy U.S.   Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the U.S.   Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products.       But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. "I have   nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current   situation," Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun.       Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data   and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market   forces. "The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise   supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess   inventories since 1985 will take some time," he said.       Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales   in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.       He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday to   forestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with U.S. Trade   Representative Clayton Yeutter.

earn	JARDINE MATHESON REPLACES "B" SHARE BY BONUS ISSUE   Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd   &lt;JARD.HK> said it will withdraw the previously announced   four-for-one bonus issue of "B" shares and replace it by a   two-for-five bonus issue of ordinary shares.       A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends   for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded   capital.       Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a   joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the   Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, and Securities Commissioner Ray   Astin, that the listings of new "B" shares would be barred.       The official announcement said this will include the   proposal by Jardine Matheson.       But the Jardine statement quoted chairman Simon Keswick as   saying: "We continue to believe that the issuing of "B" shares   would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be   given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage."       Keswick said the "B" share issue will benefit Jardine   Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue   ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting   existing shareholders' voting rights.       However, he added: "We certainly welcome (the Secretary for   Monetary Affairs) David Nendick's referral of this very   important matter to the Standing Committee on Company Law   Reform and are hopeful that the process will lead to the   development of general principles which can be embraced by all   constituents of the Hong Kong market."
trade	JAPAN GIVEN LITTLE HOPE OF AVOIDING U.S. SANCTIONS   A top U.S. Official said Japan has little   chance of persuading the U.S. to drop threatened trade   sanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for   Washington today.       Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political   Affairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan's moves   to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could   persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports   said, and replied: "...It is probably too early for the figures   to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to   permit the result you have described."       Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift   its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove   barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.       "There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,   but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from   important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on   security and political issues," he said.       "The question is whether through cooperative actions between   our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether   Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist   legislation," he said.

acq	SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS   A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN>   to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut   Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources   in the Philippine food and brewery company said.       A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB   from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's   outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on   April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former   chairman of both SMC and UCPB.       Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)   and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.       Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and   represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's   plans to sell the shares to SMC were "a serious breach of   fiduciary duties."       The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be   held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities   and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a   government nominee on the company's board.       De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,   asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by   the company's board.       On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the   sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per   share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained   earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the   purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of   dividends.       De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate   an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt   to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon   del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would   boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.       In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier   suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres   Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.       De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming   last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong   subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.   The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board   meeting.       An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to   resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by   April 15.       "The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of   a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard   of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early   disposition of the sequestered shares," San Miguel Corp said in   a statement.       "Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have   reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of   payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the   government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement   of the controversy by April 15," the statement added.       A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on   Cojuangco's court petition, adding: "Any statement coming from   us might be interpreted as adversarial."       Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which   sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible   to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United   States citizen.       The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln "A" shares,   which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln "B" shares which   are available to foreign buyers.       SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among   prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by   the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed   institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers   in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.       The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on   Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were   owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President   Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the   U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend   announced last June.       "We have no objection to Soriano buying the "B" shares," Diaz   told Reuters. "But everything is on hold now."       The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy   would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'   meeting, scheduled for May 14.       San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion   pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in   1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of   700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.
sugar	RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP   Good rains of one to four inches in the   past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in   the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an   Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.       As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a   severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since   December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet   season.       Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are   beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth   since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.       Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better   than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman   said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain   is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.       Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region   and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and   some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.       Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled   towards the end of May, he said.       The cane crush normally runs from June to December.
sugar	FRENCH TRADERS FORECAST EC SUGAR TENDER   The European Community (EC) is expected to   award export licences at today's weekly tender for above 60,000   and possibly up to 100,000 tonnes of white sugar after last   week's award for 102,350 tonnes, traders here said.       They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50   Ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week's 46.864.       Earlier, traders in London said the outcome of the tender   was very hard to predict after last week's substantial award   and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.   They said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but   declined to give a rebate figure.

nickel	NICKEL PRICES UNLIKELY TO RISE MUCH - SHEARSON   Nickel prices are unlikely to rise   significantly from current levels unless further steps are   taken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said in   its quarterly nickel market report.       The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb   yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January,   due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but   Shearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year's   buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.       Output reductions by producers will take effect later this   year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.       Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in   balance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at   556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in   1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports from   Socialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).       It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a   first quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the   last quarter. The year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb   compared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchange   cash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987   sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.

The company said 1986 dividend, which will be paid to the   Dutch state in its capacity of the firm's sole shareholder,   would be raised to 98 mln guilders from 70 mln guilders in   1985.       In an initial comment on its 1986 results, DSM said the   drop in 1986 turnover had been caused mainly by losses in the   company's fertilizer division.
dlr:money-fx	POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl   said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation   of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German   economic growth.       In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs   here, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aim   for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to   correct the trade deficit."       He said the United States could face a vicious circle of   depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that   route.       Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet   U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,   accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating   above-target money supply growth.       He said he would have been happy to have brought forward   five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to   the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced   political constraints getting such measures through the upper   house of the West German parliament.       But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could   accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.       Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about   one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial   erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing   demand at home.       "A further appreciation of the mark could even be an   obstacle to further growth," he said.       Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply   growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and   because external factors, including low oil prices and   favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.       But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma   over monetary policy.       The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the   reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany   was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.       "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more   on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary   money supply. But we must be very careful," he said.       He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's   trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as   the United States.       Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary   officials of major industrialized countries, saying the   importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange   rates had been underestimated.       All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the   right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he   said.       "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the   part of our American colleagues," he said.       But he said there was still a danger that the correction of   the dollar's value could overshoot.

ship	INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN FOR DUTCH CARGO DISPUTE   The two sides in the Rotterdam port   general cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent   chairman, Han Lammers, to preside over future meetings,   employers' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said.       Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of   Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an   agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and   unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.       Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in   protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the   4,000-strong workforce this year.       The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on   March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction   against the redundancies on procedural grounds.       The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but   Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the   employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the   complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.       Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement   in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance   workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a   spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the   sector, said.

Rod Canion, president and chief executive officer of   Compaq, said he expects sales of over 200 mln dlrs for the   period ending March 31, above analysts' estimates of 165-185   mln dlrs. He added that earnings per share would exceed   analysts estimates of as high as 42 cts a share.       Compaq reported earnings of 8.3 mln dlrs, or 30 cts a   share, and sales of 144 mln dlrs for the first quarter 1986.       The company said demand for its DESKPRO 386, PORTABLE III   and the new COMPAQ DESKPRO 286 will contribute to the sales   increase.       "The initial demand for the recently introduced COMPAQ   PORTABLE III and the new models of the COMPAQ DESKPRO 286   exceeds that of any other Compaq personal computers," Canion   said. "We saw continued demand for our personal computers   across the quarter, with March (1987) being a particularly   strong month.

acq	PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION   Senate Banking Committee Chairman   William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce   legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of   corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.       Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,   Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased   the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.       "We are proposing legislation that would provide for more   disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would   insure that takeovers are properly financed," he said.       Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold   for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a   investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a   company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within   10 days, Proxmire said.       In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement   that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have   to filed with the SEC.       Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to   prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in   knowing about coming takeover attempts.       Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a   tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60   business days from the current 20 business days.       His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring   company violated the time period on the tender offer.       To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire   said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin   requirments are properly enforced.       The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement   for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally   enforced in hostile takeovers.       Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover   declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without   actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.       He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for   failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin   requirements.       The bill also would require more disclose when several   investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.       "When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know   about it," Proxmire said.       Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain   towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all   shareholders recieve equal treatment.       He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover   defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.       Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this   month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.       He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this   year.

Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs   of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.       U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop   accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,   but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of "the high   potential of a continued suspension that would result in   reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987."       Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are   received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that   full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.       Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations   between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the   resumption of interest payments.       The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central   bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a   90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that   matures on April 15.

money-fx	STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD   West German Finance Minister Gerhard   Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries   would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on   stabilizing foreign exchange rates.       Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness   of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and   Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.       But he declined to say what measures would be discussed   ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later   today.       Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said   the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre   accord, had been underestimated.       Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major   countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual   meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,   marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major   trading partners.       "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord," he   said. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do   not want to discuss that here.       Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a   "slight firming" of the yen against the dollar.       And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged   since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell   marks to support the dollar.       "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market," he   said.       Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the   bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be   accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.       Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its   pledges for economic stimulation.       "And we will have to see if the United States is able to do   what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --   and get it through Congress," he added.       Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further   fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against   the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.       "You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And   it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem," he   said.

Out of this, traders in the U.K. Received 37,800 tonnes, in   France 34,500, in West Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in   Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes, it added.       Earlier today, London traders had declined to give a   projected view on the level of subsidy although some said total   tonnage awards would be around 60,000 tonnes.       Paris traders foresaw between 60,000 and 100,000 tonnes   being authorised for export at a 46.40/46.50 Ecu subsidy.       Cumulative sales authorisations for the current season   (1986/87) now stand at 2,194,970 tonnes (43 weeks).

earn	MEAD &lt;MEA> EXPECTS IMPROVED EARNINGS THIS YEAR   Mead Corp said the outlook for its   major paper markets looks strong for the second quarter and   augurs well for its earnings in 1987.       "The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly   improved earnings this year," Burnell Roberts, chairman and   chief executive officer said.       Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of   34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or   65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.       In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing   operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.       Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market   conditions and improved operations.       "The combination of capital improvement programs and more   employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper   operations," Roberts said.       He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are   operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has   placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle   of the year.       Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was   particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.

sugar	DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED   Roughly half of this year's expected   130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,   a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the   Netherlands, told Reuters.       Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date   for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April   23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman   added.       "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can   expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the   crop is off to a very good start," he said.       Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600   hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of   white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"   and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.       This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been   introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000   hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000   tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.       Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been   allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being   boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow   to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.       VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach   their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln   marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually   the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.       When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it   said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark   dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would   be proposed for the company's new preference shares.       Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of   the management board proposal as virtually a formality.   "Anything else would be more than a surprise," one said.

corn:grain	ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE   The Zambian government has no immediate   plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of   maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an   official of the ruling party said.       Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for   refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in   which at least 15 people died.       That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later   revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund   (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.       However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67   dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price   increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,   a practice discouraged by the IMF.       "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of   meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the   demands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry of   Agriculture economist said.

corn:grain:oilseed:sorghum:soybean:sunseed:wheat	FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED   Argentine grain producers adjusted   their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop   downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the   end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.       They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates   had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which   has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.       However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,   producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain   could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.       Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27   millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in   Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in   Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.       There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.       Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce   rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the   crops, including soybean.       However, as the lands began drying later in the week   harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40   pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.       Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested   material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield   estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.       The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at   2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast   last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of   4.1 mln.       Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9   to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.       Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area   sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will   begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.       Production estimates for maize were down from last week at   9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated   previously.       This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln   tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and   21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln   tonnes.       Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to   seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.       Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in   Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and   Buenos Aires in mid-April.       The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3   to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.       The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln   tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,   and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2   mln tonne crop.       The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,   remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5   pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for   1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of   7.1 mln.       The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln   to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln   sown in 1985/86.       The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some   areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some   experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas   making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on   this were not available.       Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which   will be sown between May and August or September, has so far   not been as intense as in previous years.
jobs	DUTCH ADJUSTED UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN MARCH   Dutch seasonally adjusted unemployment   rose in the month to end-March to a total 693,000 from 690,600   at end-February, but was well down from 730,100 at end-March   1986, Social Affairs Ministry figures show.       The figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to   436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier. The figure for   women was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier   and 259,400 at end-March 1986.       On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in   the month to end-March to 692,200. In March 1986 the figure was   725,000.       A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a   smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,   because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the   building industry. He said this explained the increase in the   adjusted statistics.       Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at   end-March. A year earlier the figure was 28,763.

Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included   West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank   President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard   Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere.       Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi   Miyazawa and Japan's central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and   British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor   Robin Leigh Pemberton.       There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian   officials.

At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who   declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven   in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful   decisions.

acq:crude:earn:pet-chem	ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY   Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.   dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will   propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record   profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,   major company executives predicted.       This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an   industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF   Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms   to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.       Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the   Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for   money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.       "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," said   Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,   "There's no major plant capacity being added around the world   now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving   the old ones."       Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,   automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of   paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.       U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about   90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike   product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,   managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand   for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up   by as much as 300 pct, he said.       Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in   Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned   last year and predicted it would have the best year in its   history.       In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel   and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.   dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entire   chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"   Oreffice said.       GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical   industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.   Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion   dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.       The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical   industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and   planning, said Pace's John Dosher.       Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks   dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar   was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost   U.S. chemical exports.       Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has   been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical   manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers   in the early 1980s.       Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers   have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program   to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate   unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of   friendly and hostile takeover attempts.       GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire   Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs   for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics   and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA>    has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer   businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.       But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be   headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on   the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as   ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that   are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.       "Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the   past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity   chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had   deteriorated," Dosher said. "But I think they will eventually   kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche   market." Some top chemical executives share the concern.       "The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting   carried away and repeating past mistakes," GAF's Heyman   cautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may be   ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."       Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the   Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700   mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.       Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout   of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1   billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants   along the Texas Gulf Coast.       The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that   are the building blocks of specialty products.       "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a   glamorous, high-margin business," Cain said, adding that demand   is expected to grow by about three pct annually.       Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said   chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for   plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood   and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical   business could last as long as four or five years, provided the   U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

acq	DOMINION CALLS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> REPORT RUMOR   &lt;Dominion Textile Inc> considers a   published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington   Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the   company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said.       "As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they   are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors," spokesman Michel   Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.       "All the information that has been given out publicly is   that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an   acquisition that big...probably based on that people are   starting all sorts of rumors," he said.       Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a   rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment   further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell   was out of town and unavailable for comment.       Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln-   U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln-   U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.       Dufour said the company has been negotiating with "many"   U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington   Industries was one of them.       Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,   which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher   Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a   takeover offer.       Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1   mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has   repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S.       The company has said it plans to diversify into new product   and market areas in addition to expanding its textile   operations.

cocoa	COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES   Major cocoa exporters are likely to   limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world   prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers   Alliance (CPA) said.       The sources said the depressed world market had been one of   the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the   11-member CPA which began on Monday.       They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the   buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his   effort to support prices.       Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed   operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London   last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the   market soon.       Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa   surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has   to buy cocoa under stock rules.       The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range   by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.       "The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,"   commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.       Another source said that with much of the 1986/87   (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in   the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.       The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in   Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.   This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West   African producers, where sales are made or authorized by   commodity marketing boards.       The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory   Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.       The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.

earn	J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING   J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its   first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its   previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status   its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.       That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest   payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20   mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the   first three months of 1986.       Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities   underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln   dlrs in the year-earlier period.       In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading   losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and   underwriting of Euromarket securities.       Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained   difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering   heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether   Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.       On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan   losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign   exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and   trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.       Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and   commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net   investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.       Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first   quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell   to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.       If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means   that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are   actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9   mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume   payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.       After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for   credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared   with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.       It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after   charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49   mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.

corn:grain:oilseed:soybean	BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS   Storage problems with Brazil's record   grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln   tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.       Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,   told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this   year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.       He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in   harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage   problems.       Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,   theoretically sufficient for the crop.       But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly   distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do   Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were   responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.       The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West   growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage   capacity.       Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and   maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains   production but only 20 pct of its storage space.       In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,   there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to   storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for   storing loose grain, Brito said.       Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the   crops.       The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop   has been evident from television reports, which have shown   enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations   had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges   for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data   through Reuter services.       "Many other markets maintain restrictions," he added.       Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that   information restrictions protected their interests.       In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the   distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage   to their own commercial information businesses.       He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the   telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect   their state monopolies at the expense of other economic   sectors.       "Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such   countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire   economies are put at a competitive disadvantage," he added.       Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from   the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues   to 620.9 mln stg.

tin	PARIS GROUP PUBLISHING DAILY FRANC TIN PRICE   The Association of White Metals has   decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per   100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.       The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was   introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for   some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals   association said.       Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and   Tuesday's at 4,790.       The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a   tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin   trading on October 24, 1985.       The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a   French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was   reliable, the spokesman said.       The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a   minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway   station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.       The French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals groups various   metal associations including the Association of White Metals.

Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's   Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a   net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs   of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value   of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said.       Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps   to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.       The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable   fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of   international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S   where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.       In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont   maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in   1986, Montedison said.       Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly   created position of president of Agrimont.

acq	TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR>   The largest U.S. textile maker focused   on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,   but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself   into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.       The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose   4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and   Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct   stake.       A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly   acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover   offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for   Montreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors."       Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.       Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of   the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if   Burlington actually came into play.       Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,   added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it   was looking for a takeover in the U.S.       Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills   and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for   a U.S. acquisition.       A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer   has been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies, but   would not say whether Burlington was among them.       "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not   unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the   housecleaning they've done," said Eileen Gormley of Thomson   McKinnon.       Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets   and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs   last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its   operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign   competition, Gormley said.       "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"   said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial   fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets   and other fabric to the auto industry.       "In the past, they just spent and never realized the return   on the outlays they did make," she said.       "You look at their record over the year, and I think   they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the   past," Gormley said.        She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up   from 2.01 dlrs per share.       Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington   at its current levels.       Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends   selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50   dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings   basis.       Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been   placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.       "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people   don't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.       Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing   managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if   he doesn't win the target company.       Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky   Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying   Ponderosa Inc.       The stocks of other textile makers rose along with   Burlington.       J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest   Cannon Inc &lt;FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and   Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

trade	JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS   Senior Japanese officials tomorrow   open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch   effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide   variety of Japanese electronic exports.       Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of   International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of   meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael   Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.       The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in   retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to   end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and   to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.       They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,   including television and audio equipment and computers.       Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little   likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct   duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.       President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27   after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986   U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that   Japan was not honoring the agreement.       In making the annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to   the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to   provide American industry with free and fair trade."       Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's   semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured   the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has   complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.       Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive   trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's   inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last   year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.       About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.       Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to   adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.       Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals   but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.       He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's   decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense   of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.       "The United States has excessive expectations.," he said. To   stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by   excess inventories since 1985 will take some time."       He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough   in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

earn	HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION   Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped   to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to   the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite   continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts   to extend world penetration.       Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln   guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.       Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's   leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,   said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.       The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,   Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,   where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.       Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker   foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.       Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the   increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila   S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly   in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The   company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in   restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.       Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit   next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had   already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.       Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the   European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer   into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer   market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "We   have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important   point," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken   had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.       "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German   market, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding that   while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a   taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very   regionalized.        Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for   African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most   important beer growth markets in the long term.        He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with   majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was   hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.       Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters   per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions   and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total   1986 sales.       On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price   of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists   have been looking at other possibilities.       To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on   the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which   had sold successfully, Coebergh said.       Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw   materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were   popular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could not   possibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said.       Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to   penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a   contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.       But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's   market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that   are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western   money.

coffee	COLOMBIA BUSINESS ASKED TO DIVERSIFY FROM COFFEE   A Colombia government trade official has   urged the business community to aggressively diversify its   activities and stop relying so heavily on coffee.       Samuel Alberto Yohai, director of the Foreign Trade   Institute, INCOMEX, said private businessmen should not become   what he called "mental hostages" to coffee, traditionally   Colombia's major export.       The National Planning Department forecast that in 1987   coffee will account for only one-third of total exports, or   about 1.5 billion dlrs, with oil and energy products making up   another third and non-traditional exports the remainder.
crude	TURKEY CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DISPUTE   Turkey said today its disputes with   Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean   Sea, should be solved through negotiations.       A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between   the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute   and an agreement on this issue would effect the security,   economy and other rights of both countries.       "As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be   found by bilateral negotiations," the statement said. Greece has   repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the   International Court of Justice.       The two countries approached armed confrontation last month   after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the   Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.       A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to   territorrial waters. "The latest crises created an historic   opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,"   the Foreign Ministry statement said.       Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to   meet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek   reply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister   Turgut Ozal. The contents of the message were not disclosed.

rice	GATT OFFICIAL MEETS WITH U.S. FARM LEADERS   The official in charge of   agricultural matters in the new round of global trade talks is   in Washington today and tomorrow to meet with congressional and   Reagan administration officials.       Aart de Zeeuw, chairman of the General Agreement on Tariffs   and Trade's negotiating group on agriculture, met this morning   with members of the House Agriculture Committee.       Committee sources said De Zeeuw expressed concern over   protectionism and high farm price supports. House lawmakers   noted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loan   rates, committee staff said.       "Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (U.S.) loan   rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally," one source   said.       De Zeeuw was told of the U.S. lawmakers' frustration with   Japan's restrictive rice import policy, and members defended   the U.S. dairy policy, which aims to cut surplus production by   subsidizing producers to trim herds, sources said.       Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculture   members and Undersecretary of State Affairs Allen Wallis.       Tomorrow, De Zeeuw is to meet the House Ways and Means   Trade Subcommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, before   visiting Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.       De Zeeuw goes to Canada later this week. His trip to North   America is part of his attempt to meet farm policy leaders in   the key GATT member states.       The negotiating group on agriculture held its first meeting   in February and is expected to meet again in May.

dlr:interest:money-fx	J.P. MORGAN&lt;JPM> SAYS DLR MAY PREVENT FED EASING   The relatively high level of real U.S.   interest rates suggests that there is scope for further   declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is   unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains   volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.       He said in response to a reporter's question after the   bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline   further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that   as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."       On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the   dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.       He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate   was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of   rates."       Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.   economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this   year.       He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline   and oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5   to four pct rate in 1987.
earn	MEDTRONIC &lt;MDT> SEES 15 PCT EARNINGS GROWTH   Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct   growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30,   1988.       At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the   year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or   about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.       In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,   or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.       Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will   improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and   expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.       Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per   share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have   heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.       He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its   businesses and not in its dividends. "Shareholders are better   off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends   or share repurchases," he said.       Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total   worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,   from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.       He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic   products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and   lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will   double that by 1995.       Wallin said, "Our objective is to get a hold of new   products and start building market share if we have to beg,   borrow or steal to get into new markets."       In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with   a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators   also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and   a needless overprescription of pacemakers.       "We have no knowledge of any major problems in our   pacemakers or leads," Wallin said. "We intend to re-establish   our company as the quality leader in the industry."       Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said   the company intends to diversify internally and through   acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,   such as drug delivery systems.       Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does   not include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have some   safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions   from an acquisition."       Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity   in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.       The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber   pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical   activity.       Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a   rate responsive pacemaker.

tin	TALKS CONTINUE ON TIN AGREEMENT EXTENSION   Discussions on the possible extension of   the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the   quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but   the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member   states.       A number of producer governments in particular have not   decided their final position on whether the ITA should be   extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on   June 30, according to delegate sources.       Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to   back an extension, with the exception of Britain, which   undertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later.       Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member   countries declare their positions on the possible extension.   Today's full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT   after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC   coordination meeting.

Kell Houssels III told Reuters.       He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of   its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino   and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter   and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.       But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988   should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the   contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.       Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third   quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.       Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic   City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest   expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility   directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest   as it had been able to do previously.       Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and   gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming   was completed earlier in the week.
earn	SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> LOANS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL   Security Pacific Corp said it is   placing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on a   non-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce first   quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after   taxes.       Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,   Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter   earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share   reported for the first quarter of 1986.       The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln   dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.       Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs   of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.       Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion   dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since   February.       In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments   for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted   the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the   country's export revenues.       In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record   interest income only as it is received in cash.       The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an   agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume   later in 1987.       The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York   when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask   banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term   debt that matures on April 15.

A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a   significant victory and were continuing to advance.       Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km   (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied   ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three   divisions attacked.       The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under   assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery   and tanks.       "Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge   the last foothold" occupied by the Iranians, it said.       (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000   Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)

It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot   down.       Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of   the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore   terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to   attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.

Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas   producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned   by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD>.       The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on   1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of   165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.       Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per   barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per   mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the   company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom,   Indonesia and Pakistan.       In the United States, Union Texas said it completed   evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska's Colville Delta   area.       "Although significant oil reserves were confirmed,   development of this discovery will not be economical without   substantially higher prices," the company said.       Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over   the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in   the Gulf of Mexico.       In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for   capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985   and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also   said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as   well as petrochemical-related businesses.
acq	UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY   UAL Inc may have a response this   afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United   Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.       "Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we   need to get a clarification out," the spokesman said, adding   that there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be released   today.       The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for   2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.       Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several   weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer   Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also   held discussions with its chairman.       The developer indicated in those talks that he took the   position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.       Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying   UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2   mln shares.       "United has got to consider this proposal. I think the   pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,   but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL   management," said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.       Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack   when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz   rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a   strategy to become a travel service company.       The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union   concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention   on its airline.       UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its   new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.       But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has   been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100   dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as   widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe   the stock is in play.       Market sources have said that although Trump attracted   attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a   catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps   throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.       "The first domino is you have an investor with a   considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type   of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"   said Pettee.       "What's interesting is the values are there. There's   something for everybody," he said.
earn	HARTMARX &lt;HMX> TARGETS EARNINGS GROWTH   Hartmarx Corp, following a year of   restructuring, continues to target record earnings for fiscal   1987, Chairman John Meinert told the annual meeting.       Meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the   remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that   goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx   reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down   from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.       The 110-year-old apparel manufacturer recently posted   first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year   ago.       Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any   of its divisions. He added, "We have the financial capacity to   take advantage of acquisitions."       In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10   redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta,   Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.       He said the company's women's apparel continues to grow,   and Hartmarx has on the drawing board a Briar concept store   which will feature ties, shirts and some tailored clothing.

money-supply	FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER   Robert Heller, a member of the   Federal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" of   growth in the money supply this year.       "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a   most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for   delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,   Calif.       A text was released in Washington.       He said the effect of lower inflation and financial   deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.       "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest   levels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed   after mid-January.       "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates   were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as   well," he added.       Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.       "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to   price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial   for our economic future," he said.       Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising   import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces   emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more   market share for U.S. producers.       "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be   the result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.       He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be   disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy."        Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal   discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather   than new taxes.       "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle   inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in   international markets," Heller said.       He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct   during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.       A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with   Canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American   producers to compete more effectively in that country," Heller   said.

Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said on entering   the meeting the ministers would review the Paris agreement.   Asked if he was satisfied with West German and Japanese   stimulus, Wilson replied, "They could do a little more."       French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, meanwhile,   confirmed there would be a communique at the end of the   meeting.       Finance ministers and central bankers of Britain, FRance,   Canada and West Germany were seen by Reuter correspondents   returning to a Treasury building.       Japanese officials and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl   did not appear to have left the building at the end of earlier   Group of Five talks which broke up around 2 p.m. local time   (1800 gmt).       There was no sign, however, of the Italian delegation whose   position was thrown into question this morning by the   resignation of the Christian Democratic wing of Italy's   Socialist-led government.       European monetary officials said later that the Italian   delegation was inside the building.       This meant that a full blown meeting of the Group of Seven   was in progress.
carcass:livestock	U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY   The U.S. meat and poultry inspection   programs are incapable of protecting consumers from   contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and   consumers charged.       "The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has   been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the   public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated   meat," Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of   Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.       "The American consumer has little reason to feel confident   about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him   today," said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community   Nutrition Institute.       "Company management is less concerned about the risk to   health than about raising plant output and company profits,"   Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on   Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.       Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government   Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose   violations of federal law, demonstrating a "serious breakdown in   the entire inspection system."       Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being   contaminated by "intestines dragging in a water trough used to   flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,   chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow   their noses."       Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture   Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended   the government's program, calling it "one of the most respected   public health programs in the world."       FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5   billion chicken and turkeys every year.       Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with   change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in   the meat and poultry supply has increased.       He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium   salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time   and much money to contain the growing problem.       Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is   found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw   pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.       The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20   years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.       "We certainly really have not found an effective means of   turning this disease around," said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)       The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS   intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for   detecting microoganisms.       But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls   would cost too much.       "Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily   complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real   goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and   economical meat supply for consumers," Stanley Emerling,   executive vice president of the National Association of Meat   Purveyors, said.       Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new   program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at   certain plants "voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be   repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic   of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor   legal recourse."       Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the   panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.
acq	CHRYSLER &lt;C> RENAULT DELAY AM MOTORS &lt;AMO> PACT   Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des   Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks   the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's   proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.       The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on   March nine set April nine as the target date for completing   negotiations.       However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of   that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.       The two companies said they "now plan to complete work by   April 23."       Chrysler and Renault said, "Given the complex nature of the   deal, the need for additional time was to be expected."       The March letter of intent between the two companies says   that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date   "in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers   an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'   investigation of the company," referring to American Motors.       A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem   had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's   statement that more time was needed because the talks are   complex. "That is our definition of the delay," she said.       Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,   their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or   when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend   by a written agreement by both companies.       The Chrysler spokeswoman said, "We are still working toward   a definitive agreement." Said another Chrysler official who is   not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in   trouble: "There are no glitches."       Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. "I   can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done," said   Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson.

earn	GENERAL ELECTRIC &lt;GE> 1ST QTR HELPED BY RCA   General Electric Corp said its   first quarter results were significantly higher due to the   strong results of RCA, which was acquired last year.       General Electric also attibuted continued strong   performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers   Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.       GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624   mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or   1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.       General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the   company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE   earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results   are in line with those expectations.       General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and   station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was   not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for   its strong earnings.       It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was   much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments   than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.       Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first   quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of   RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.       In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last   year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.       General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln   dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were   charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It   added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after   taxes from an inventory accounting change.       And technical products revenues and operating profit were   ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical   systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's   communications and related services.
copper	TECK STILL IN TALKS ON B.C. COPPER VENTURE   &lt;Teck Corp> said it   was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at   Highland Valley, British Columbia, held by affiliates Cominco   Ltd &lt;CLT> and &lt;Lornex Mining Corp>, but did not know when   negotiations would be completed.       Teck vice-president of administration John Guminski said in   reply to a query that the talks had been "ongoing for a long   time." He declined to speculate on the outcome.       Cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by Teck, is   optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman Don   Townson told Reuters.       "I think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be   resolved," Cominco's Townson said.       "We're optimistic that they will be concluded shortly," he   added. Townson declined to specify when the talks might end.       Cominco and Teck's 22 pct-owned Lornex agreed in January   1986 to form the joint venture, merging their Highland Valley   copper operations.       Cominco and Lornex share equally in control and management   of the Highland Valley operations, while Cominco has a 55 pct   share of production and Lornex receives 45 pct.       For the six months following July 1, 1986, when the venture   officially started production, Highland Valley had total ore   milled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pct   copper, Townson said.       Cominco's share of production was 43,000 short tons of   copper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of Molybdenum   in concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of   gold, he said.

Xebec also said it expects revenues to total about 23 mln   dlrs.       The company reported a second quarter loss last year of 1.9   mln dlrs, or 14 cts per share, on 23.9 mln in revenues.       Xebec said IBM has historically accounted for about 50 pct   of the company's revenues, but that total fell to 20 pct during   the quarter just ended.       IBM had used Xebec's hard disk drive controller products in   the IBM PC/XT, a product which IBM is phasing out.

corn:grain	SOUTH KOREA CORN IMPORTS MAY INCREASE - USDA   South Korea's purchase of about 2.4   mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to   double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the   United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic   jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.       In its World Production and Trade Report, the department   said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season   (Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln   tonnes from the United States.       During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln   tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.       Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in   light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from   China, Argentina and South Africa, it said.

The requirement is not expected to affect the number of   Mexican steers imported into the United States and the brand   will be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports of   entry.

grain	USDA SEEKS COMMENTS ON GRAIN DISCOUNT SCHEDULE   The U.S. Agriculture Department is   seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the   Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) discount and premium   schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan   collateral or under price support programs.       The premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality   factors such as moisture content and kernel damage. The   schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing   grain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.       The department said it is possible that producers could be   encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC by adjusting   the premiums and discounts.       Comments are due by April 24 and a report to Congress is   required by law by May 10.

interest	WOJNILOWER SEES DROP IN U.S. INTEREST RATES   The Federal Reserve will promote lower   interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,   First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.       As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against   inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without   subverting national U.S. economic policy.       "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,   because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States   decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their   commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its   part by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report.       "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or   seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants   have seen little to fear," Wojnilower said.       He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency rates   and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese   window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.       Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average   economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up   seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building   and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross   national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.

iron-steel:trade	CANADA TO MONITOR STEEL IMPORTS, EXPORTS   Canada plans to monitor steel shipments   flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease   concerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel   exports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.       "To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market,   the government is taking further action to ensure we have more   accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not   used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,"   Carney said.       Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to   exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were   considering establishing a joint commission to study the   growing steel problem.       Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an   amendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the   monitoring program.       Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct   cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the   level just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.       The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of   growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from   several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic   steel industry.       Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the   American market be limited to 2.4 pct.

crude:nat-gas	U.S.SENATE LIFTS SOME BANS ON NATURAL GAS   The Senate unanimously approved   legislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural   gas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burning   plants.       The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairman   Bennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of   natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers   from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to   pay higher than market prices.       "This legislation will open up new natural gas markets," the   Lousiana Democrat said.       The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a   shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.       "Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,"   Johnston said.       In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new   baseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate   modifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate   fuel.

Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in   1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline   from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had   a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion   dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46   billion in 1985.       In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline   Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are   among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07   dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas   reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet   in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.       The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has   less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should   show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of   changes tariff and federal tax rates.       The company's gas marketing business is expected to have   somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its   operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing   unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.       Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its   debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln   dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and   proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams   Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a   2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not   be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.

"...there are conditions which may indicate that the   company will be unable to continue as a going concern,"   auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annual   report to shareholders.       Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing   an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and   restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.       However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986   year end, said it expects "to have sufficient cash to meet its   obligations for the next 12-month period."       Last July the bank holding company reached a debt   restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries   and five non-bank operations for disposition.       "The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financial   condition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able to   survive as a going concern," the report said.       Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to comply   with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory   agreements and on its ability to return to profitable   operations, it said.       There can be no assurance that Hawkeye will be able to meet   these requirements. However, the company "believes it will be   able to do so," Hawkeye said.

Dome said in the filing that its debt plan proposes making   payments under a five year income debenture to the lender whose   debt is secured by Dome's Encor shares.       After the five years are up, "under certain circumstances   the shares of Encor may be required to be disposed," the company   said.       Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for   part of its debt to &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,   estimated last year at 947 mln dlrs.       Analysts have said Commerce Bank was pressing Dome to sell   the stock to pay down its debt.       Dome's Encor shares had a market value of 313 mln dlrs on   March 17, 1987, the company's filing said.       As previously reported, Dome is seeking approval in   principle for the debt restructuring plan. Dome said in the   filing it proposed lenders sign a letter of understanding in   early April, with implementation to be effective July 1, 1987.       Dome Petroleum reiterated in the SEC filing that its   existence as a going concern is dependent on continuing the   interim debt plan, due to expire on June 30, and winning   agreement for its proposed restructuring plan.       "The company believes that the negotiation and   implementation of the proposed debt restructuring plan is   realistic and achievable," Dome said.       "However, the final outcome of the negotiations cannot be   predicted at this time," it said.

trade	DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT   Financial analysts say they are   pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal   budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help   improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.       The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow   to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming   fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.       Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan   that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next   year.           "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is   infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little   impact on the economy and the trade deficit," said Stanley   Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.       "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collander   said in an interview.       Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly   told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way   to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease   some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.       The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade   imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker   has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught   with danger.       Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as   imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign   capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.       In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other   major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of   the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates   should be stabilized at around current levels.       As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to   take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States   agreed to cut its budget deficit.       The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a   way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is   to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.       "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else   you do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recent   testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.       Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the   government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit   supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or   to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United   States.       Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the   current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.       Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed   that any deficit reduction was better than none.       But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were    not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it   needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar   from plunging further in world exchange markets.       "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if   your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the   Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer   is, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.       The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's   most vexing and persistent problems.       The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet   little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,   though administration officials have predicted it will drop by   about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.       In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep   worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the   federal budget.       On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not   attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for   the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced   budget law.       While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for   next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget   Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall   short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.       "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the   most you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time,   said Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than that   would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."       Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up   short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.       "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable   reduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will now   look like a failure to Wall Street."       The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would   lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year   beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting   defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their   anticipated spending levels for next year.       The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of   nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new    taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

coffee	COLOMBIA COFFEE REGISTRATIONS REMAIN OPEN   Colombia's coffee export registrations   remain open and there are no plans to close them since a new   marketing policy means an unlimited amount can be registered,   Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters'   association said.       "The philosophy of the new policy is not to close   registrations. Nobody so far said may would be closed," he told   Reuters.       On March 13, Colombia opened registrations for April and   May for an unlimited amount.       Without giving breakdowns, Arango said private exporters   had registered 1,322,804 bags this calendar year up to April 6,   or roughly 440,000 bags per month, slightly lower than the   average in recent years.       He estimated the amount of bags registered by the national   coffee growers' federation at about the same, meaning a total   of about 900,000 bags registered and sold per month by   Colombia.

acq	MORE AMERICAN BRANDS &lt;AMB> ACQUISITIONS SEEN   American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs   acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquor   business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by   the tobacco company, analysts said.        "They were very frustrated with their inability to get   Chesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition. It   doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one," said   Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co.       American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion   dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to   buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been   speculating that American Brands would find another candidate   to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.       "This is just typical," said George Thompson of   Prudential-Bache securities. "There's going to be more to come   here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because   tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position   is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,"   he said.   cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business   does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can   therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the   National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin   and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the   type of acquisition they envisioned.       "The distilled spirits business has been in a steady   gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,"   said Thompson.    REUTER...
interest:money-fx	BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION   Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler   called on central banks of major industrialised nations to   cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.       In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released   here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was   protectionism and control on capital movements.       "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market   transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have   them," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would   have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop   to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.       Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets   had parted company with transactions in goods, services and   investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that   determined market trends.       Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to   grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates   would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.       "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are   different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --   those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of   mounting economic activity," Koehler said.       The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.   Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation   going by talking the dollar down posed problems.       The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep   rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost   of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports   to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to   make itself felt compared with the price effect.       "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going   further than would be necessary to adjust the current account   over the medium term," Koehler said.       A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur   only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.   In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should   rise faster than GNP.       "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.       If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be   prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by   an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..       But only if there was an appropriate interest rate   differential would Europe and Japan look for financial   investment in the U.S.       When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank   had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its   measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.       Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates   by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading   interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market   and its substantial impact on exchange rates.       It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of   price stability, economic growth and full employment but also   to tackle international problems like the exchange rate   problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.       A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding   of non-inflationary economic growth in an international   monetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.       Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was   necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed   to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over   the next few years and intervention points should not be set,   because they were only testing points for the market, he said.       In order to keep the international monetary system free of   disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but   also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

Unadjusted, the number of unemployed rose to 702,600 from   699,600 in February but the rate eased to 9.0 pct from 9.1,   reflecting a slight increase in the estimated workforce. In   March 1986, 640,400 persons, or 8.5 pct of the workforce, were   out of work.

grain:rice	JAPAN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON RICE TALKS REPORT   The Agriculture Ministry declined comment   on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks   on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.       "We have no idea about the report and cannot comment," a   spokesman told Reuters.       Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,   said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng   and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its   intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for   farm talks.       The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue   at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade   talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.       Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff   Control Act.       Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about   mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan   will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is   justified, it said.       The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade   round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.

acq:trade	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY   Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and   Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force   to be reckoned with, political analysts said.       MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.   And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of   a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,   they said.       "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of   a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"   said one diplomatic source.       "They are a potent political force," the diplomatic source   said.       But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not   always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts   said.       "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not   so internationalized," said Waseda University professor Mitsuru   Uchida. "Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world   community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to   face the situation."       Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with   London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep   a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in   Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.       The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival   groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one   competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now   monopolizes the business.       It has also opposed a major management role in the planned   merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on   the grounds that no such international precedent exists.       The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has   threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger   plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open   its telecommunications market.       Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it   says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car   telephone and satellite communications market.       Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the   sector it regulates.       "What has been happening is an important shift in the   economy which makes the ministry a very important place," said   James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory   Service Inc.       A decision to open the telecommunications industry to   competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted   rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.       "With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto   legal framework," said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell   Whitten.       Close links with the powerful political faction of the   ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime   Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the   analysts said.       "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka   faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance   of MPT," Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of   the influential political group, he added.       The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to   the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the   Postal Savings System, analysts said.       MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate   interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial   liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal   Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than   banks, they said.       Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's   obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized   the ministry as feudal.       Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting   competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its   wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest   price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.       But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of   its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world   including Britain, several analysts said.       "The United States is really the odd man out," Abegglen said.   "For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order   in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable   view," he said.
money-fx:trade	G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING   Following is the text of a statement   by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,   Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting   yesterday.       1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of   seven major industrial countries met today.       They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of   their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened   economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of   their heads of state or government.       The managing director of the International Monetary Fund   also participated in the meeting.       2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to   the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,   and noted the progress achieved in implementing the   undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.       They agreed, however, that further actions will be   essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain   global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.       In this connection they welcomed the proposals just   announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan   for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's   economy through early implementation of a large supplementary   budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as   unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.       The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further   open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.       3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that   around current levels their currencies are within ranges   broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic   policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.       In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation   of the Louvre Agreement.       They concluded that present and prospective progress in   implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this   statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to   foster the stability of exchange rates.

interest	GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT   Remarks by two leading central bankers   sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in   the West German three pct discount rate may be under   discussion, currency dealers said.       Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that   monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows   required cuts in interest rates.       Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter   Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below   its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was   not making a forecast on interest rates, however.       Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar   gained slight background support from the speculation.       But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80   pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money   market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either   offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate   and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.       It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less   than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact   expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could   move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.       Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative   capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of   whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.       "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are   different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --   those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of   mounting economic activity."       Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the   generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the   first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a   counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade   showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion   roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8   pct.       Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued   to grow in 1986.       Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West   to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export   and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the   West.

The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for   118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous   week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.       Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to   obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one   Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,   the sources said.       They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had   to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from   operators protesting that rebates are too low.       Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.   But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless   the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.

yen	JAPAN BUSINESS LEADERS SAY G-7 ACCORD IS WORRYING   The leaders of two of Japan's top business   groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)   accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to   Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the   yen's current level as appropriate.       Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic   Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well   above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.       Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for   Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen   from rising further.       "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as   the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara   said.       G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.   And West Germany said in a statement they consider their   currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with   economic fundamentals.       Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to   intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange   rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.

Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the   company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.       He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18   mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15   1987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazo   said. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."       PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February   1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila   Stock Exchange.       Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,   would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.       PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68   pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six   billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.       At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.       A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to   be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to   three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax   from which it was previously exempt.       The government has not so far ordered the implementation of   the tax decision.       PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the   Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014   telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments   in the country.

nat-gas	MALAYSIA SEEKS 42 BILLION YEN PIPELINE LOAN   Malaysia has asked Japan for a 42   billion yen 25-year loan to finance the construction of gas   pipelines from eastern Trengganu to southern Johor, the   Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) said.       OECF's chief representative, Takashi Matsuya, told   reporters the Japanese Government is appraising the loan.   Another OECF official told Reuters Japan is likely to approve   the loan because "it is technically and economically viable."       If approved, the loan would carry a coupon rate of four   pct, a grace period of seven years, Matsuya said. It would be   disbursed over three years, he added.       The pipeline contruction is the second phase of the   Peninsular Gas Utilisation Project by Petronas, Malaysia's   national oil company.       The first phase was the supply of gas to households in and   around the eastern oil town of Kertih.

Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in   terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,      planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer   ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to   the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.       Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was   nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.       The sources said it was too early to give details of the   planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a   likely date for the flotation launch.       So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33   mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to   large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to   ten shareholders before the flotation.       The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln   franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday.   "The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,"   CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.

rubber	MAJOR RUBBER PRODUCERS TO MEET IN SINGAPORE   Officials from Indonesia, Malaysia,   Singapore and, perhaps, Thailand will meet here tomorrow to   discuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing and   ways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said.       The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in the   four countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.       This is the first time Indonesia is attending such a   meeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may not   be able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia,   Indonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubber   exports and Singapore is a major regional rubber trading   centre.       The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting and   contracts for rubber are among other issues expected to be   discussed.       Last month, rubber importing and exporting countries   adopted a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva.   The new pact is more responsive to market trends than its   predecessor, the sources said, and earlier provisions allowing   the buffer stock to borrow from banks have been eliminated.

dlr:money-fx	EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE   European currency markets reacted quietly   to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers   ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to   surprise that the markets should have expected so much.       The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies   and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which   reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency   stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.       Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining   broadly entrenched in its current trading range.       "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84   marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank   AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.       However, she said the dollar could break out of the range   with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.   Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.       Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd   in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against   the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,   possibly to 140 yen.       A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects   a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.       London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb   underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative   sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank   operators to test the downside.       Concern that finance ministers and officials still in   Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of   currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with   worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the   near term, the traders said.       Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the   communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's   downward trend.       Traders in several centres said the market would look for   fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to   defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly   consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy   intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."       Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said   "They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The   U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.       However, some dealers said London-based operators would be   unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long   Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825   marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.       Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said   the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable   market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme   volatility seen in the first few months of this year.       One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the   communique made clear the leading nations did not want a   further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.       The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to   1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre   accord's supposed currency target range.       A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were   ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."       But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique   contributing to greater stability.       "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big   boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he   expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks   in the next three months.       A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said   the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and   should not have produced disappointment.       "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade   policies to redress current imbalances are of a different   timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told   Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time."       Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in   Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on   currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent   remedy?" he asked.       Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only   the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully   in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.       A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was   now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by   Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could   lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.       Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in   pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months   while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to   support the Paris accord.
interest:money-fx	GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS   Remarks by central bankers raised some   hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase   pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a   move in the near term, money market dealers said.       Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday   that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from   speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central   bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower   limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.       Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the   drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.       Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment   this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.       The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in   new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80   pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,   as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.       But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the   pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,   and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to   3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.       The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on   repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.       Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more   discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than   the more public adjustment of leading rates.       The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and   allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case   since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may   allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.       Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the   15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.       Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.

trade	EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS   The European Community launched an   investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese   semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark   an intensification of world trade strains.       Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington   for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it   imports into the U.S.       The EC Executive Commission said today the European   Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that   Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable   programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.       Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM   market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been   forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in   order to compete with the Japanese.       The Commission said it believed the Association had given   sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an   investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found   the complaints were justified.       The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.   And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged   access to the Japanese market.

dlr:money-fx	EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE   European currency markets reacted quietly   to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers   ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to   surprise that the markets should have expected so much.       The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies   and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which   reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency   stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.       Frankfurt and Zurich dealers saw the dollar staying broadly   entrenched in its current trading range.
money-fx	FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY   Finance ministers from seven major   industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize   currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to   reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.       In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the   U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the   value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct   now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to   boost their economy.       West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it   a "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters   other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.       Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign   exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened   again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.       The communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmed   the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent   Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will   be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain   global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."       It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling   Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the   communique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including   an "unprecedented front-end loading of public works   expenditures."       The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought   together ministers and central bank governors of the seven   major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West   Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.       The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment   on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris   when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the   then-current levels.       In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall   against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by   the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at   around postwar lows.       Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United   States and European countries for its only modest efforts to   open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its   exports.       The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open   domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not   elaborate.       It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around   current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly   consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy   intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."
earn	AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS   Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>   reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln   guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits   for 1987.       Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion   guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its   revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a   change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would   have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.       Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly   due to its life insurance business.       Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose   despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and   higher personal risks.       Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage   insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.       In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and   life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change   in accounting for U.S. Annuities.       AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal   investment influences that it should be accounted differently   from the more traditional insurances.       This change in accounting practice and another change to   account for profits made on fixed interest investments,   resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln   guilders.       AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits   were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial   costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The   Hague.       In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged   in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial   costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.       Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in   May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these   costs and made only a small contribution to the group's   profits.       AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill   for Monumental Corp.       AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December   1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.
money-fx:trade	G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING   Following is the text of a statement   by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,   Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting   yesterday.       1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of   seven major industrial countries met today.       They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of   their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened   economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of   their heads of state or government.       The managing director of the International Monetary Fund   also participated in the meeting.       2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to   the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,   and noted the progress achieved in implementing the   undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.       They agreed, however, that further actions will be   essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain   global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.       In this connection they welcomed the proposals just   announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan   for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's   economy through early implementation of a large supplementary   budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as   unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.       The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further   open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.       3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that   around current levels their currencies are within ranges   broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic   policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.       In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation   of the Louvre Agreement.       They concluded that present and prospective progress in   implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this   statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to   foster the stability of exchange rates.
money-fx	G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi   Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed   their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the   market of their resolve.       At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa   said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a   totally new statement was needed.       The speculative selling did not reflect economic   fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a   reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he   said.       He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had   concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the   mark, had remained stable.       Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the   Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.       "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression   of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.       The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the   range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.       It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing   a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,   Miyazawa said.       Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the   statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven   because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other   major currencies largely have been stable.       He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has   justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other   nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short   period since the Paris agreement.       Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese   semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7   meeting and did not affect the currency talks.       The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing   countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative   outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.
yen	YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE   The yen is likely to start another   uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies   because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new,   currency and bond analysts here said.       "Is that it? I was expecting something more than that," said   one trader at a major Wall Street securities company.       Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: "The   market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."       The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days   just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying   bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting   of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven   industrialized nations in Washington.       After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a   communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's   view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent   with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability   should be fostered around these levels.       The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.       "They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with   fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line   when it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?," asked   Republic's Cohen.       Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled   speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are   prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is   still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.       Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the   key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the   authorities' permissible range.       Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would   probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop   up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market   intervention and public comments.       Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of   Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of   dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.       The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively   selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade   data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion   dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.
yen	JAPAN BUSINESS LEADERS SAY G-7 ACCORD IS WORRYING   The leaders of two of Japan's top business   groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)   accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to   Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the   yen's current level as appropriate.       Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic   Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well   above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.       Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for   Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen   from rising further.       "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as   the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara   said.       G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.   And West Germany said in a statement they consider their   currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with   economic fundamentals.       Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to   intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange   rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.

dlr:money-fx	EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE   European currency markets reacted quietly   to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers   ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to   surprise that the markets should have expected so much.       The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies   and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which   reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency   stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.       Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining   broadly entrenched in its current trading range.       "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84   marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank   AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.       However, she said the dollar could break out of the range   with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.   Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.       Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd   in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against   the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,   possibly to 140 yen.       A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects   a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.       London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb   underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative   sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank   operators to test the downside.       Concern that finance ministers and officials still in   Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of   currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with   worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the   long term, the traders said.       Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the   communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's   downward trend.       Traders in several centres said the market would look for   fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to   defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly   consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy   intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."       Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said   "They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The   U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.       However, some dealers said London-based operators would be   unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long   Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825   marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.       Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said   the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable   market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme   volatility seen in the first few months of this year.       One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the   communique made clear the leading nations did not want a   further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.       The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to   1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre   accord's supposed currency target range.       A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were   ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."       But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique   contributing to greater stability.       "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big   boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he   expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks   in the next three months.

grain:wheat	FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation   (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to   fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.       FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world   grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in   1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet   Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.       World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to   rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the   impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly   distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.       "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many   developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially   on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.       FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at   a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last   season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986   harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.       FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised   upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of   substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.

The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest   profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one   cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a   profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year   earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.       It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of   chief executive officer.       Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.   Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A   convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default   under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.       It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the   debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements   requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and   about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.       The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the   non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at   the end of any 30 day period.       Physio Technology said it is changing its field sales force   to independent representatives and dealers from employees to   "significantly reduce its fixed overhead."       Its statement did not indicate how many employees would be   affected by the move.       The company said Lane will become an independent dealter   for the company in certain midwestern states. He will continue   to serve as a director, it added.

A steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the U.S. Gulf to Morocco   and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the Gulf to   Taiwan. A vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat   flour from the Gulf to Aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500   dlrs.       Grain from the Great Lakes to Algeria made 28 dlrs against   27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of March.       Market talk suggested a Federal Commerce vessel had been   booked to move grain from the Great Lakes to Morocco on Comanav   account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of   oilseeds from British Columbia to Japan, but no confirmation   was obtainable.

interest:money-fx	BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE   The Bundesbank sees no current reason   to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger   told Reuters in a telephone interview.       Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks   yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West   Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers   said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts   may once again be under discussion.       Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his   two central bank council colleagues.       But he added that the last central bank council meeting on   April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of   "subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news brought   by several state central bank presidents.       "Much is going better than the impression gained by the   public from the January figures, which have been in the   meantime superseded," he said.       German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a   decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9   pct after they had been unchanged in December.       Bank economists said that the two together showed the   economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter   of 1987.       Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a   steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark   rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto   Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF   meeting.       Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates   on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase   tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, "Since the central   bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14   days, this is hardly probable."       Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved   away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of   targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no   comment on the subject while negotiations were still in   progress in Washington.

dlr:yen	U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS   The United States, which has long   sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be   satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and   allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement   to stabilize currencies.       Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury   Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced   yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.       But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial   powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,   the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.       And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far   East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that   currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the   countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point   despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.       Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the   movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading   ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.       "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past   several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the   discussions in Paris," Miyazawa said yesterday.       The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was   announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of   Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's   meetings of leading industrial nations.       In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action   "extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris   Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges   broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.       The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West   Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore   repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to   foster exchange rate stability.       The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central   bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the   dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of   intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent   years. Monetary sources also said they understood that   Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely   successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.       They also said there was a growing feeling among the   finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over   medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term   differences in past meetings.       West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like   the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of   yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other   countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.       Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that   major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance   between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's   trade deficit have already taken place.       No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut   the budget deficit even though it is implied in the   reafffirmation of Paris.       European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are   essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that   reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.       A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this   week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further   sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose   substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could   undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.       Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the   politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.       Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany   welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own   currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.       Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak   dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the   Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.       The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making   their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian   Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.       Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit   to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.       The United States and France, backed by the International   Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a   limited number of economic objectives such as growth,   inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current   account balances.       Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in   consultations between the countries on whether corrective   action should be required.       But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives   has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it   implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.       The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully   sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit   currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.       The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges   of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the   relatively free currency markets of recent years.

gnp	GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS   The global economy is expected to   weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious   poverty outlook, economic analysts said.       For finance ministers and central bankers attending this   week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund   and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an   additional concern.       The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct   this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.       In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a   measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to   2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.       For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,   another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0   pct from 3.5 pct last year.       The new figures are considered a major disappointment to   the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the   industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil   prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope   with growing mounds of debt.       IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed   the industrial country economies would move up to an annual   growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.       Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some   time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into   an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.       Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier   states for markets for their products as well as financial   assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations'    economies poses fundamental worries.       Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have   only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,   including the key one of exports.       The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,   has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it   too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only   2.3 pct, according to the IMF.       For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the   United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to   ignite their economies but with little apparent success.       The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and   the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade   deficit.       Reagan administration officials have been saying that the   impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much   slower than expected.       The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it has   to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to   work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years   to get a resonably complete effect."       The report added, however, "the adjustments may take even   more time on this occasion."   REUTER^M
interest:money-supply:trade	SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES   The head of Spain's employers'   federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried   about the government's monetary policies because high real   interest rates were hampering investment.       He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this   year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation   target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by   keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.       High real interest rates were attracting an influx of   speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the   government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.       Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,   liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17   pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a   target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.       To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money   rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from   11.8 at end-1986.       Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to   hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,   with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new   wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.       These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish   workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.       He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the   state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five   pct wage ceiling.       Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in   Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first   two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct   increase over the corresponding period last year.

lead	LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS   Lead prices have risen this week against   a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders   said.       Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying   or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.       London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at   a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and   prices tending to drift lower.       This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low   level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical   demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.       The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be   felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,   stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders   said.       The lower supply levels result from a number of different   factors around the globe.       Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries   because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish   exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at   Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant   additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have   been drawing on LME stocks.       In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,   South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks   for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet   commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.       And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes   per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks   and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the   U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and   a regular supplier to the world market.       Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,   have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.       On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up   quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported   in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the   first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying   order was filled by merchants in March.       Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices   this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and   establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months   delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in   Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often   a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.       On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp   and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,   and this is believed to be in strong hands.       Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest   level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses   which are not popular with merchants putting together   shipments.       But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since   the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to   secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies   affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on   the transport of used batteries.       Labour negotiations in North America will play an important   part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts   expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,   Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.       Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract   expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of   strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.       Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting   speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current   firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium   to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at   midsession.

Hutton said the offer, which had been conditioned upon the   tender of at least 5,116,892 Purolator shares, or about   two-thirds of the outstanding shares, was terminated because   the minimum number of shares was not tendered.       Purolator had entered into a definitive agreement with PC   Acquisition, part-owned by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of E.F.   Hutton, and some officers of Purolator's U.S. courier division,   in which PC offered to purchase 6,332,471 Purolator common   stock shares for 35 dlrs a share.

grain:rice:sorghum:wheat	INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88   India's national foodgrain target has   been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged   from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its   annual report for 1986/87.       Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87   due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological   sub-divisions of the country.       The report gave the targets for various crops with   estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,   in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains   including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).       Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was   possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying   growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.       The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with   greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in   fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding   total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84   respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4   mln.      India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes   of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year   development plan ending March 31, 1990.       Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the   1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap   of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three   years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more   than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with   good weather, the report said.       "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water   (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of   improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm   materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be   vigrously pursued," it said.

earn	REICHHOLD CHEMICAL &lt;RCI> SETS ANTI-TAKEOVER PLAN   Reichhold Chemical Inc said its   board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred   stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each   common share outstanding.       The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to   protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts   to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all   shares.       Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any   specific takeover attempt.       Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy   one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of   preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with   dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one   share of the company's common stock.       The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's   prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of   the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result   in 20 pct ownership, the company said.       Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five   cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or   before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two   pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in   connection with certain transactions afterward.       The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1,   1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said.       Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed   to stockholders.

Spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared   with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil   imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159   mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.

Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with   1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large   ammount of investment goods entering the country with the   recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.

The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it   would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on   1986 business, despite the provision.       One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency   dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from   the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but   the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."       VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board   meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in   detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign   currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing   company.       VW has said computer programs were erased and documents   were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes   transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign   currency losses were not completed.       VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was   arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having   evaded justice.       Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985   profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and   parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend   an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has   also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,   which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held   dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.       VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5   billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment   on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,   since the new capital was in preference shares.       The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in   order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At   the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly   less than three billion marks.

Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has taken   steps to improve margins. He said revenues are expected to   increase modestly because of the company's decision to downsize   its leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from a   one-time Texas teacher assessment project and the impact of the   discontinuance of products last year.       Oswald said National Computer's first quarter results will   be down as a result of a major financial systems sales last   year, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number of   shares outstanding.       The company said the next three consecutive quarters should   demonstrate "excellent earnings growth."

interest	LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES   Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of   the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest   rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.       Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven   countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said   central banks would continue to intervene "as and when   necessary."       He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more   to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.       Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a   simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West   Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget   speech to the British Parliament.       "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is   still a risk," he said.       Asked if the United States should consider increasing   interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is a   need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to   be a rise in interest rates in the United States."       Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's   meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in   reducing its budget deficit.       "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in   reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it   continue year after year," Lawson said.       The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to   stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six   weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against   the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.       Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in   the Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been   no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."       Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson   said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode   ... but one has to be vigilant."       He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that   "current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been   "carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the   same thing," he said.       Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese   measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of   weakness for that agreement.       Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's   presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate   domestic demand.       They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate   increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package   also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during   the second half of this year.
barley:corn:grain:wheat	FRENCH FREE MARKET CEREAL EXPORT BIDS DETAILED   French operators have requested licences   to export 320,000 tonnes of free market barley, 225,000 tonnes   of maize, 25,000 tonnes of free market bread-making wheat and   20,000 tonnes of feed wheat at today's EC tender, trade sources   said.       For the barley, rebates of between 138 and 141.25 European   currency units (Ecus) per tonne were sought, for maize they   were between 129.65 and 139 Ecus, for bread-making wheat around   145 Ecus and for feed wheat around 142.45 Ecus.       Barley rebates of up to 138.50 Ecus were requested for a   total of 40,000 tonnes and at 139 Ecus for 85,000 tonnes.       Rebates of up to 130 Ecus per tonne were requested for a   total of 55,000 tonnes maize and up to 131 Ecus for 105,000   tonnes, the sources said.
potato	U.K. POTATO FUTURES TRADING NOT TO BE SUSPENDED   Trading on the London potato futures   market will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of the   London Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statement   to floor members.       It was in response to strong representations by the Potato   Marketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion of   price which they say will result in large deliveries into the   physical market when the April futures position expires.       The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futures   trading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore the   relationship between futures and physicals.       Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering   of the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigations   by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), the   International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and other   parties, found no evidence to substantiate this.       The main complaint from some sections of the physical   market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over   the PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded this   morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB's   average price of 104 stg.       Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is   a two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality   potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying   between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser   quality grades have traded below 100 stg.       Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered   against the April futures contract between now and the end of   the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.       Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management   committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice   and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.

In the communique issued this morning, the G-10 said   "prospects of member countries' economies would be improved by   stability in the exchange rates of their currencies."       The G-10 includes the group of seven - the United States,   Canada, Britain, Japan, Italy, West Germany and France - plus   Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and also Switzerland.       Sources who attended the G-10 conference this morning said   the reference to the latest G-7 agreement was especially added   to the brief communique because currency stability will benefit   all the G-10 members.       The G-10 met briefly before the International Monetary Fund   Interim Committee meeting scheduled for today.   .

Stability in sterling versus the dollar continued to apply   pressure to a market which is coming close to testing a   psychological chart support base at 4,200 stg, traders said.       Dealers said major consumers still need to cover their May   and June requirements but are holding out for even lower   offers. Reported high grade tin business in London was confined   to end April metal at 4,225 stg.       Small-scale spot business was reported by West German   operators at 12.60 and 12.63 marks per kilo although the market   was still being undercut by Chinese material, which traded at   one stage down to 12.54 marks per kilo, traders said.
dlr:money-fx	DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT   The dollar drifted down to end one   pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the   lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and   comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.       Dealers said the communique early in the European morning   from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and   although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further   attempts to push it lower through the day.       The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below   yesterday's last 1.8365/75.       Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was   based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to   comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated   adherence to international agreements such as those set at the   Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.       Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7   as "soft as wax."       Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in   a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no   current reason to change monetary course at present.       Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks   yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West   Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers   said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts   may be under consideration.       German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70   pct after 3.80 yesterday.       Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added   via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next   week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation   at an unchanged 3.80 pct.       But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger   said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this   theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."       Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers   comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around   3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional   1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.       Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965   last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks   per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to   1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.       EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last   night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing   however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.

iron-steel	TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES   Steel stocks, which have had a healthy   runup recently, still present some short term investment   opportunities, according to some steel analysts.       But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm   prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end   soon. They recommend taking profits.       "It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal," said   Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. "Orders will be   strong for about two months, and there are signs that some   (order rates) are starting to dive already."       But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees   some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp   &lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel   Industries Inc &lt;IAD>.       "There is still some attractiveness to steels over the   short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and   rising prices," Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,   however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to   make them more efficient.       Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to   recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.       Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance   sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business   has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford   noted. "It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but   they've come a long way," he said.       "We think the stock will do moderately better than the   market," he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,   could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.       Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,   before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,   against losses last year.       Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he   said.       Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. "We had a buy   on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have   it," he said.       The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a   share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and   from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. "But a lot   depends on oil prices," he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales   come from oil and natural gas.       Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of   Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. "The company's done a lot   (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit   for," she said.       She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was   trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a   share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in   1986.       Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has   been recommending the stocks since last November.       Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group   although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the   third quarter.       But he sees potential trouble beyond then. "I think (steel)   prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,"   he said.       Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal   dropoff later in the year. "But there are more positives than   negatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic   industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should   cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on   an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.       The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes --   25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.       Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains   in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have   affected quality, the report said.       Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana and   slightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is of   fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.

They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in   Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.       "The cocoa market is completely free.

money-fx	U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS RATE SHIFTS ORDERLY   Treasury Secretary James Baker said   that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and   have improved the prospects for a reduction in external   imbalances to more sustainable levels.       In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim   Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last   night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the   Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies   within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."       Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally been   orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of   external imbalances to more sustainable levels."       As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances   "simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers.       He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strong   domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely   with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.       "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing   what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he   said.       Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's   executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's   compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this   fall.       "We should pay particular attention to the lack of   continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF   and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed   temporary," he said.

"We believe that significant increases in taxes would not   reduce deficits and could have adverse effects on growth,"   Sprinkel told the House Rules Committee.       He said the Administration wanted to continue its policy of   gradually reducing deficits through restraining government   spending and promoting economic growth. Sprinkel said cutting   the budget deficit was the best way to lower the trade deficit.

National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an   opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance   of orders.       "I think the sales price was higher than most people   expected," said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.       A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will   be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts   per share last year, including the spirits and wine business       "They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That   will ease their interest cost burden," said Henry.       National Distillers sold its wine business last month to   Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.       Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net   only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor   businesses.       Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of   buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.   National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and   assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the   time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine   businesses, moving more into the chemical area.       For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and   propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor   businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from   discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was   67 cts per share.

However, orange production in the region for marketing year   1986/87 is forecast at 565,000 tonnes or 25 pct of the total   Italian orange crop, it said.

corn:grain:oilseed:soybean:wheat	BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT   Based on field travel in the   Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about   average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture   Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.       The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about   20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.       It said generally favorable weather from early December   through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.       However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days   followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second   week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans   which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the   report said.       The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create   serious storage problems, the report said.       Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by   more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are   expected to be above average, it said.       Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop   crop has been harvested.       During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain   elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the   report said.       New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana   accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons   for the decline are expected reduced government support price   and good summer crop harvests.

Southmark said it will compute the cash price paid based on   the average closing market price of the rights on the American   Stock Exchange for the first ten days the rights are traded,   beginning April 6.       In order to get the dividend for these rights a Southmark   shareholder must own common stock on the ex-dividend date,   April 27, the company said.       After that, Southmark said its common stock will be traded   on an ex-rights basis.
coffee:trade	EXPORTS OTHER THAN COFFEE RISE SHARPLY IN COLOMBIA   Colombian exports other than coffee rose   55 pct in January compared with the same period last year,   figures from the government statistics institute show.       Non-coffee exports amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared   with 147.5 mln dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last   year.       The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared   with a 56 mln dlr surplus in January 1986.       The national planning department forecast that in 1987   coffee, Colombia's traditional major export, will account for   only one third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.

retail	U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER   U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales   were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a   recovery in April.       "Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but   underlying business is better than the numbers indicate," said   Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.        Analysts generally average the sales results of March and   April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This   year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three   weeks later than last year.       Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said   sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a   seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted   5.7 pct last year.       "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate   that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear   to be because liquidity and employment are rising," said   analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.       Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in   according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected   to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.        In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket   items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many   analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the   holiday nears.       "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a   continuing strength in the housing market," said Edward   Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an   overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's   sportswear were also excellent.       "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even   a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment   due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"   said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner.        J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were   among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales   declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and   catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's   overall sales rose 4.8 pct.       Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continued   strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from   very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed   southwest."       "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity   wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,   but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of Bear   Stearns.       Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for   the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a tougher   comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."       Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower   than last year.       "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are   being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales   are coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.       Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to     be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of   the year.       Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of   May.

Should these loans remain on nonperforming basis for the   rest of 1987, net income for year will be cut by about 3.2 mln   dlrs, the bank said.       Earlier it posted net income for the period of 14.7 mln   dlrs or 87 cts a share, up from 11.7 mln dlrs or 73 cts a   share.       Total nonperforming assets were 114.1 mln dlrs at March 31,   up from 53.4 mln dlrs at December 31 and 79 mln dlrs at March   31, 1986 the bank said.       The provision for loan losses for the first quarter was   eight mln dlrs compared to 11 mln a year ago. Net loan charge   offs were six mln dlrs, down from 11 mln dlrs a year ago.

carcass:livestock	DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY   Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European   Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this   year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth   disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.       The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the   EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC   veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.       The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has   already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to   bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy   industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export   revenue.       "The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally   when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of   beef exports," one industry source said yesterday.        Commenting on EC policy, he explained, "Depending on the   seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then   decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting   beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension   on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are   still awaiting their decision," he added, asking not to be   identified.       Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of   high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had   spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and   upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.       Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be   forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low   prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales   could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.

sugar	U.S. CONGRESSMAN INTRODUCES REAGAN SUGAR BILL   Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced   in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the   Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a   spokesman for Porter said.       The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any   changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress   last month.       That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12   cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be   compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,   to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to   growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.       Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the   proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.

tin	CONSENSUS SEEN ON TIN PACT EXTENSION   The quarterly session of the   International Tin Council (ITC) continued without formal   agreement on an extension of the sixth International Tin   Agreement (ITA), but delegates said it was apparent there was a   general consensus the Agreement should be prolonged.       Some delegations are still awaiting formal instructions   from capitals, but informally most have indicated they favour   an extension, delegates said.       This afternoon's session was used by delegates to seek   further clarification on some of the issues involved, and to   discuss internal matters.       Some sources were optimistic a resolution on an extension   could be passed tomorrow but others suggested a special session   would be convened to adopt the resolution after the Association   of Tin Producing Countries meeting April 14 to 16.

The official denied trade reports that the government might   have substituted a private deal with Islamic Corp for the   original tender.
strategic-metal	HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE   The House Armed Services Committee   has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled   materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.       The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and   quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.       The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill   which will be voted on in the House next month.       The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee   yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage   sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a   staff member of the committee told Reuters.       "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being   managed properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile   over the last 10 years has been atrocious."       Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a   White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.       The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee   the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over   decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.       The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs   worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The   stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.       He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage   the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.       These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget   and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.       The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile   management was counter-productive, he said.
trade	CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY   Canada's trade picture has brightened   considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector   would post a long awaited recovery this year.       The federal government reported today that the monthly   surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,   double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than   February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.       "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said Richardson   Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.       Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the   next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the   year.       "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the   year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is   indicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at the   Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.       Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23   pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion   dls in the month.       "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of   exports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in its   monthly report.       Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85   billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion   dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.       Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end   up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal   10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion   dlrs.       Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched   off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85   U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after   closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.       The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early   afternoon trading.       Economists have been banking on an improved trade   performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish   Canadian economy.       Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched   off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85   U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after   closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.       The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early   afternoon trading.       Economists have been banking on an improved trade   performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish   Canadian economy.       They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at   a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays   this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into   the country.       Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United   States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be   strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer   spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.       "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export   performance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland's   Donegan.       But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist   Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and   said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's   trade upturn.       Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing   signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate   that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is   probably transitory."
earn	FIRST BANK &lt;FBS> SEES LOSS ON BRAZILIAN LOANS   First Bank Systems Inc, in reporting   higher first quarter net, said that if interest is not paid on   the 140 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans and nine mln dlrs in   Ecuadorian loans for the rest of 1987, its profits for the   entire year will be cut by 6.9 mln dlrs.       The banking firm said the non-performing status of these   loans cut first quarter net by 1.7 mln dlrs.       Earlier it reported first quarter profits of 57.4 mln dlrs   or 95 cts a share, up from 46.6 mln dlrs or 80 cts a share in   the year-ago period.       Nonaccrual loans, restructured loans and other real estate   were 637 mln dlrs, or 2.24 pct of total assets, compared to 514   mln dlrs or 1.84 pct of assets at the end of 1986 and 636.1   mln, or 2.46 pct of assets at March 31, 1986.       The provision for loan losses in the quarter was 35 mln   dlrs, compared to 152.1 mln in the first quarter 1986, when   there was a special addition to the reserve of 100 mln dlrs.   Net charge offs were 34.7 mln, compared to 41.1 mln dlrs a year   earlier.   REUTER^M

According to the department's Export Sales Report, covering   transactions in the week ended April 2, corn transactions   consisted of 140,600 tonnes of new sales and changes in   destinations for 35,000 tonnes.       Total corn commitments to the USSR  for delivery in the   fourth agreement year amount to 2,825,600 tonnes. The Soviets   have not purchased wheat or soybeans in the fourth year of the   agreement.

The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to   issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows   stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half   price.       Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean   that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its   rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board   approval.

strategic-metal	HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE   The House Armed Services Committee   has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled   materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.       The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and   quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.       The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill   which will be voted on in the House next month.       The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee   yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage   sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a   staff member of the committee told Reuters.       "They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being   managed properly," said the staffer. "Management of the stockpile   over the last 10 years has been atrocious."       Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a   White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.       The staffer said that under the measures passed by the   committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence   over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.       The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs   worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The   stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.       He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage   the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.       These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget   and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.       The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile   management was counter-productive, he said.

grain:wheat	SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA   The U.S. Agriculture Department   increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet   Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.       In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the   USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because   Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last   month.       USDA said the increased purchasing is "somewhat surprising"   because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.       All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,   USDA said.       Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12   mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes   miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.       USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered   through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.       The severe winter "is believed to have resulted in above   average winter-kill," USDA said.       Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses   maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying   grain recently.       USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes   grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat   and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.
acq	DISNEY FAMILY MAKES BID FOR HOLLY SUGAR &lt;HLY>   The Roy Disney family disclosed in a   filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it made   a bid to acquire Holly Sugar Corp for a package of cash and   securities.       Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family   company, said it submitted the bid on April 8 to Salomon   Brothers Inc, Holly Sugar's investment banker.       The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face   value of 70 dlrs, and a "contingent payment certificate" that   would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each   share of Holly Sugar outstanding.       The Disney family already holds 101,300 Holly Sugar shares   or 9.0 pct of the total outstanding following purchases of   12,500 shares March 13-April 17, Shamrock told the SEC.       Shamrock said it had asked for certain information about   Holly Sugar's financial condition but had been turned down. It   said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions.       "Once we have had an opportunity to complete our due   diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of   certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel,   we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal,   including price," it said in its April 8 letter.

earn	SONY CHAIRMAN FORECASTS LOWER PROFITS THIS YEAR   Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> chairman Akio   Morita said Sony's profits would be sharply down in 1987 as a   result of the dollar's decline.       Sony Corp posted net consolidated income of 41.89 billion   yen (290 million dollars) in 1986, 42.6 pct down on 1985's   73.02 billion yen (506 million dollars).       But Morita added that Japan would benefit from the strong   yen by saving on its energy import bill and he expected profits   to recover from 1988 onwards.       He was speaking to reporters at a sony factory opening   here.

The USDA projected an average yield of 1.50 gallons of FCOJ   per box versus last month's estimate of 1.47 gallons.       The government estimated Florida orange production   (excluding Temples) at 122.9 mln boxes versus 124 mln last   month. Temples were unchanged at 3.4 mln boxes.       Traders and analysts said the unexpectedly large yield   increase outweighed the anticipated drop in box count.

copper	NORANDA BEGINS SALVAGE OPERATIONS AT MURDOCHVILLE   &lt;Noranda Inc> said it began salvage   operations at its Murdochville, Quebec, mine, where a fire last   week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.        Another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as   24 hours before they were brought to safety.       Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is   still unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed   6,000 feet of conveyor belt.        Noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp   leading into the zone where the fire was located. The company   said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation   along several ramps and drifts in the mine.        Noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone   will not be completed before the end of April.       Noranda said the Quebec Health and Safety Commission, the   Quebec Provincial Police and Noranda itself are each conducting   an investigation into the fire.       Production at the mine has been suspended until the   investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter   produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680   people.        The smelter continues to operate with available   concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said. Reuter

crude	U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL   The United States' dependency on   foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,   according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry   Research Associates.       Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference   here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much   as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high   level of 47 pct in 1977.       "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is   inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil   imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.       Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for   33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to   40 pct by 1990.       "However, the rate of this growth can be affected   positively or negatively through government action or   inaction," Lichtblau said.       He said that one of the government's negative actions is   the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a   disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash   flow for oil exploration.       Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor   price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.       "An international floor price adopted by all or most   industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective   measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if   we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.       Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic   fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen   U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.       A potential for alternative supplies could limit the   willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.       Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer   tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic   Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans   for alternative energy.

Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major   purchasers, the department said.       Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell   31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week   average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the   Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by   reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.       Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400   tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700   tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the   Department said.       Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200   bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88   season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level   but nine pct below the four-week average.       Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed   by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.   The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,   Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.       Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than the   prior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers.

"I am encouraged by the continuing improvement in   earnings," Danworth said. "The first quarter met our   expectations."       Westinghouse recorded net income for the first quarter of   151.6 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, on revenues of 2.32   billion dlrs.       Danworth attributed the results to an increase in the   operating profit in the energy and advanced technology,   industries and commerical segments.

money-supply	U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 361 MLN DLRS   U.S. bank discount window borrowings   less extended credits averaged 361 mln dlrs a day in the week   to Wednesday, April 8, the Federal Reserve said.       Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591   mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln   dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement   period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln   dlrs in the first week of the period.       Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on   April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of   447 mln dlrs.       A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no   large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in   the week ended Wednesday.       Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for   65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when   net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a   high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90   pct of the borrowing.       Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a   day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28.       Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between   one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday.       The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in   holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems.       About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected   non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve   bank.       As-of adjustments ranged from minus 500 mln dlrs on Monday,   when cash letter errors at two eastern reserve banks were   corrected, to plus 500 mln dlrs on Thursday, when a correction   was made to unposted funds at a single bank.       In the first half of the statement period ended Wednesday,   banks held excess reserves on the first four days of the week   but ran a deficit on Wednesday.       In the second week, they ran a deficit on Thursday, Friday   and Monday but held excess reserves on the final two days.
copper	NORANDA BEGINS MURDOCHVILLE MINE SALVAGE   Noranda Inc said it began salvage   operations at its Murdochville, Quebec mine where a fire last   week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.        Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is   still unknown but the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor   belt.       The company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe   rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine.       Production at the mine has been suspended until   investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter   produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986.        The smelter continues to operate with available   concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said.

crude	CRUDE OIL NETBACKS UP SHARPLY IN EUROPE, U.S.   Crude oil netback values in complex   refineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last   Friday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore,   according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.       The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S.   relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly   gasoline, and support from crude oil prices.       Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe   rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices   there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or   three pct from the previous week.       In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to   19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.       Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a   barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.       But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell   sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample   distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.       Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of   68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.       For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were   mostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of   Kuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light   fell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs.       On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A.   also jumped sharply, up 40 cts a barrel or 2.2 pct to 18.82   dlrs on higher gasoline prices.
money-fx	TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY   Treasury Secretary James Baker said   the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as   had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances   from emerging in the global economy.       In remarks before the afternoon session of the   International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he   was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.       "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need something to give   it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction   when the wind shifts."       He said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" but   added that structural indicators can help focus attention on   some policies.       Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to move beyond   macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that   can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific   relevance to the imbalances we face today."       The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given   a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article   IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.       Baker also told the policy making group that it was time   for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF   surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the   public.       "In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF   appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of   follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF   recommendations, and greater use of special consultation   procedures," he said.       Baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for moving   beyond rhetoric to action."       He said they provide "more structure to the system, and   induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of   policy coordination."       He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be   reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.       "This should be matter of priority for the executive board,"   he said.       Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative   medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help us   focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by   identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the   implications of these options."       He said also that further work should be done on finding   paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.       "If we are to take effective remedial action when there are   significant deviations from an intended course, then we must   have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for   key variables," he said.

cotton:gold:grain:livestock:money-fx:silver	U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS   Commodities from gold to grains to   cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses   in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of   inflation and economic instability.       Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New   York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a   troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.       A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that   inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations   to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve   Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,   Harris Upham and Co., in New York.       The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from   the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their   commitment to support its value, and despite reports of   intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.       Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known   as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term   direction of the currency markets.       "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "If   they do, it's not evident."       "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market   take values to where they should be.       "One way or another, we will force our major trading   partners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correct   the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.       "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long   time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's   going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's   happening," he said.       The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities   cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.       At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds   saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning   to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty   McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of   Dominick and Dominick.       The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout   the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton   posted broad gains.       Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the   grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome   supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate   export demand.       After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department   raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by   two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.       Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the   Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately   higher.       Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said   hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at   this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field   work to market animals.

Keith Goodrich said.       "We'll have a substantial increase in earnings from   continuing operations," he told reporters after the annual   meeting. He said he expected profits would recover last year's   lost ground and reach 1985 results.       In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to   139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share. The total excluded losses   of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations.       Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for   acquisitions related to its core areas of business forms   manufacturing or handling.       "We could do a large acquisition," he said when asked if   the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this   purpose.       Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's   question, told the annual meeting that a special resolution   passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred   shares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to   pursue an acquisition.       "If we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we can   move with a certain expediency," Sinclair said.       Asked if the resolution was designed to give Moore   protection from a possible hostile takeover, Sinclair said   only, "I know of no threat to the corporation at this time."

dlr:interest:money-fx	ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE   Economists said that they doubt the   Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite   higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week   statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.       Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged   393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln   dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were   1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.       "One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it   probably isn't," said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.       Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy   modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the   two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging   around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.       However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest   two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand   often pushes up borrrowings.       "Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it   looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions   late in the statement period and didn't quite make it," said   Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.       A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that   the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or   more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.       Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in   its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer   reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.       The Fed took no market reserve management action last   Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added   temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of   customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves   directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.       Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the   two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on   Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's   overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.       "It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at   this time," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.       Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi   said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest   rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak   economies in the United States and abroad and add to the   financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.       "Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest   statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar   tumbled," said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.       He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new   statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's   Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed   to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.       In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in   Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that   the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade   imbalance between the United States and Japan.       The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for   steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average   Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where   the rate has been since early November.       "I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter   policy to help the dollar, as some suspect," said Sullivan of   Dean Witter.       If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just   nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from   six to 6.10 pct previously.

dlr:money-fx	DOLLAR OPENS AT TOKYO RECORD LOW OF 143.75 YEN   The dollar opened at a record Tokyo low   of 143.75 yen despite aggressive Bank of Japan intervention,   dealers said.       The previous record low was 144.70 yen set on March 30. The   opening compares with 143.90/144.00 yen at the close in New   York.       The central bank bought dollars through Tokyo brokers just   before and after the market opening, the dealers said.       The intervention took place when the dollar fell to 143.20   yen, one dealer said.       The dollar opened at 1.8155/60 marks against 1.8187/97 in   New York.       The dollar fell as low as 142.90 yen despite central bank   intervention at 143.00 yen, dealers said.       Selling pressure was strong from securities houses and   institutional investors in hectic and nervous trading on   underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar, they said.       Most dealers were surpised by the dollar's sharp fall   against the yen in New York, although many had expected such a   drop to happen eventually.       Institutional investors are expected to sell the dollar   aggressively if it rises to around 143.50 yen, dealers said.       The U.S. Currency steadied well above 143.00 yen after Bank   of Japan intervention and scattered short-covering, they said.       The dollar opened at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs against   1.5085/00 at the New York close.       Sterling started at 1.6190/00 dlrs against 1.6195/05.

interest:money-fx	U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE   Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial   markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's   wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that   is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.       For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline   as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell   sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.       But that confidence is now cracking as the financial   markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's   often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.       "Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar   freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it," said   David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.       The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in   40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington   failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a   credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short   of further depreciation of the dollar.       Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid   worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare   away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.       The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12   dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike   in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down   by 33 points to 2339.       Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the   markets' instability frightening. He believes economic   fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that "once   you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."       "There's a stark possibility that you could get a   destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates   and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic."       Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics   in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the   controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and   264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.       "We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But   the agony may be fairly drawn out," Marris told Reuters.       Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this   year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it   would take very little to touch off what he calls the second   phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the   dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.       The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on   March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.       The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with   historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are   not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its   decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.       Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest   weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks   suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling   below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as   part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.       Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of   confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced   plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic   imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.       Many economists believe that long-run stability will not   return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is   addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the   massive budget deficit.       But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of   central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no   choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.       "The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a   substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding   cut abroad, at least by Japan," said Lanston's Jones.       Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest   rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for   American farmers, Latin American governments and others.       But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and   Co, scoffed at the notion. "It's ridiculous to think the Federal   Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak   against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar   weakness," he said.       Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being   made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.       "We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the   budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody   cares," he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69   will have been greater.       He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and   thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.       But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that   a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. "Put on   your helmets," Giordano said.

interest	JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE   Bank of Japan sources said the bank   has no plans to cut its discount rate.       They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan   during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower   its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel   any need for a cut at all.       Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters   earlier today that some countries - those with strong   currencies - might have to cut interest rates.       The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to   call the G-7 pact a failure.       The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's   renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by   remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the   dollar's fall had been orderly.       They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's   comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since   the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,   not the currency's recent movements.       They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize   on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or   the other.       The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more   weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market   stability than on other currencies.       Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers   that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would   reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the   U.S. And world economies, they said.       In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors   reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources   said.       Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,   Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about   currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.       This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a   triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and   dollar/European currencies.       At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did   not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did   not object to the yen strengthening, they said.
ship	AUSTRALIAN UNIONS AND NSW GOVERNMENT REACH DEAL   Union and New South Wales government   officials have reached a compromise in a dispute over workers   compensation, averting increased industrial action in the   state, union sources said.       But some unions, including those of building and mining   workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would   continue their strikes for a few more days.       State officials said the government had agreed to revise   its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly   higher cash benefits for injured workers.       Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and   other industrial action in the state on April 7, workers'   compensation would have been cut by one third. Full details of   the compromise package are not yet known.       The Labour Council, affiliated to the Australian Council of   Trade Unions (ACTU), had threatened to paralyse New South Wales   unless the government modified its pending legislation on the   issue.       State officials said the only sectors affected in the past   three days were some government building projects, railway   freight movement and cargo handling in Sydney's ports.
crude	ECUADOR CRUDE OIL OUTPUT TO RESUME NEXT MONTH   Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil   output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring   Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said.       Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which   damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at   Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific.       About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some   50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said.       Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the   earthquake.       The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in   Colombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to the   Pacific ocean port of Temuco.       The government estimates it will take about four more   months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return   output to normal levels, the spokesman said.

It said the government and private exporters shipped 41,607   and 15,045 tonnes respectively.       Private exporters concluded advance weekly sales for 48,062   tonnes against 22,086 tonnes the previous week.

"But what would be useful is a greater differential in   interest rates," he said.

trade	JAPAN WARNS U.S. IT MAY RETALIATE IN TRADE DISPUTE   Japan warned the United States it may   take retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its   planned trade sanctions on April 17, a senior government   official said.       Shinji Fukukawa, Vice Minister of the International Trade   and Industry Ministry, said in a statement Japan would consider   measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and   other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on   some Japanese exports as planned next week.       However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade   talks with the United States despite its failure to convince   America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of   emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday.       Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in   retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July   1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets   outside the United States and to open its home market to   American goods.       Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not   listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the   pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation   of why it planned to impose the tariffs.

sugar	SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM   A sugar mill which was this   nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,   saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from   Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.       The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)   will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to   40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,   the company said.       "Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO   regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane   after April 10," the mill warned planters earlier this week.       Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen   months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking   oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer   prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing   hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.       At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to   receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a   warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound   (45-kg) bags of sugar.       "We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.   We have no money left to continue operations," Rigaud said.       He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an   additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.       Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier   two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.       He said the government then began importing refined sugar   at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and   the provisional military-civilian government that replaced   Duvalier last year continued the policy.       "But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete   with smuggled Dominican refined sugar," Rigaud said.       HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above   the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.       It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian   supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a   minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.       Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. "We're dead,   and it's the government that's causing us to die," declared   Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.
trade	TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS   Taiwan announced plans for another round   of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade   talks with Washington which officials described as a move to   help balance trade with the United States.       Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's   Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of   products included 60 items asked by Washington.       "The move is part of our government efforts to encourage   imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United   States," he said.       He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet   that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,   apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut   by between five and 50 pct.       The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday   and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting   on April 20, he added.       Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700   foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its   growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's   largest trading partner.       Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and   pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade   deficit with Taipei.       Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6   billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It   widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78   billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.       Today's announcement came before a departure later today of   a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of   trade talks with U.S. Officials.       The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last   night he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he would   face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist   sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus   with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.       Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.   Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,   purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,   import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.       "I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from   our talks with the U.S.," he said without elaborating.
trade	BRITISH MINISTER SAYS HE WARNED TOKYO OF SANCTIONS   A British minister said he had given the   Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against   Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its   internal markets "and it was clearly understood."       Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his   return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were   beginning to appreciate the need to be "fair and open" about   access to their own markets.       At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition   charges that his trip had been a failure because he had   returned empty-handed.       "I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear   message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very   clearly, and it has been clearly understood."       Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the   govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions   against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in   Britain.       "It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing   operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries   from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing   them to carry out other kinds."       "I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it   clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use   them."       He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became   involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained   more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.       "I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this   relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to   be fair and open about access to their own markets."       On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc   &lt;CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of   telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told   the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.       He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and   Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday,   he said.       Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher   said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan,   but would have to coordinate action with its European Community   partners.       Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials   yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a   range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States   markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as   it has threatened.

SAMA decreased the offer price on the 900 mln riyal issue   to 99.50586 from 99.51953 last Saturday. Like-dated interbank   deposits were quoted today at 6-3/8, 1/8 pct -- 1/8 point   higher than last Saturday.       SAMA offers a total of 1.9 billion riyals in 30, 91 and   180-day paper to banks in the kingdom each week.
coffee	UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES   Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)   has stopped offering coffee on the international market because   it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.       The board suspended offerings last week but because of its   urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it   could sustain, the sources added.       Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been   waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had   trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the   Kenyan port of Mombasa.       Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by   holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from   coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.       The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money   and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty   for such delays, it added.       Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that   commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings   -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the   current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100   billion.       The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of   annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.       The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export   earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is   likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.       CMB officials have forecast that because the government has   restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will   produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending   September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

corn:grain:rice	DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS   A prolonged dry spell has damaged   111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces   in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials   said.       They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce   estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of   rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing   conditions continued until next month.       Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the   losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in   other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry   spell.       Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),   representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8   mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.       About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at   170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.       Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been   hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total   thus the damage is considered negligible.       In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by   production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified   into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.        The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production   in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to   320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no   reports of actual damage.
jobs	SPANISH UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS SLIGHTLY IN MARCH   Spain's registered unemployment fell by   10,465 people to 2.97 mln or 21.4 pct of the workforce in   March, Labour Ministry figures show.       Registered unemployment in February was 2.98 mln people, or   21.5 pct of the workforce.       The figures were nonetheless higher than those for March   1986 -- 2.8 mln people and 21 pct of the workforce.
cpi	HUNGARY RAISES PRICES IN EFFORT TO CURB DEFICIT   Hungary has announced sharp price   increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of   its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.       The official MTI news agency said the government decided   consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state   spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average   18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.       MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,   with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also   announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including   higher pensions and family allowances.       Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to   47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the   Finance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between   30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.       A major tax reform, including the introduction of a   Western-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in   an effort to cure problems in state spending.       But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the   authorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's   deficit under control.       The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated   economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for   imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive   hard currency, the diplomats said.       The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect   the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in   other East Bloc states, notably Poland.

cotton	CHINA WANTS TO BUY 5,000 TONNES PAKISTANI COTTON   China is negotiating with Pakistan to   buy 5,000 tonnes of cotton this year, after importing the same   amount last year under a barter agreement, Chinese consulate   sources said.       Chinese ambassador Tian Ding told a meeting of Pakistani   industrialists on Thursday that China intended to increase   imports from Pakistan to reduce a trade imbalance.       Pakistani officials estimate the country's cotton output   from the current crop at a record 7.6 mln bales (375 pounds   each). Last year's output totalled 7.2 mln bales and domestic   consumption was just below three mln bales, they said.
bop:cpi:gnp	AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST CUT SPENDING, ANZ SAYS   The government must announce harsh cuts   in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give   an adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZ   Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> said.       Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the   backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14   billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly   Business Indicators publication.       "For the past two years, the government has struggled with   an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it   sees as politically practicable," it said.       The political climate meant there would be a continued   over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and   maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.       "The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival   of business investment will be further postponed," it said.       The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by   export and import-replacement industries which had created a   false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of   payments crisis were past. "Unfortunately, successful adjustment   to Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains a   long-term process," it said.       In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate   overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP)   rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.       The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP   this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow   strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at   end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.       Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988   from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were   expected, ANZ said.

The central bank had placed buy orders at that level and   prevented the dollar from falling when it came under heavy   selling pressure from investment trusts and trading houses,   they said.       However, the intervention failed to boost the U.S. Currency   significantly from the 142.20 yen level, they added.       The dollar was trading around its midday rate of 142.30   yen. It had opened here at 141.85 yen.
earn	TEXACO SEES BUSINESS LITTLE HIT BY BANKRUPTCY MOVE   Texaco Inc &lt;TX> said its decision to   file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy   code will not affect the majority of its businesses.       It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its   32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,   plant and equipment, were free of the action.       Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating   subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are   affected, it said.       But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents   per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments   on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.       Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were   demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a   result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.       Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond   of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985   judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's   1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost   matches the damages awarded against Texaco.       Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin   to attach its assets to secure the judgment.       Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut   Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to   the Texas courts.       Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all   Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of   the Pennzoil lawsuit.       "Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond   issue and the larger dispute failed," James Kinnear, Texaco's   president and chief executive officer, told reporters.       Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on   Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until   the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.       Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash   bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of   earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not   sell any assets, Kinnear said.       Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of   credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under   11.1 billion dlrs, he added.       Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the   company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on   Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for   bankruptcy.       He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a   confidentiality agreement between the two companies. "Texaco   told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go   to bankruptcy court," Jamail said.       Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would   prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were   ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

cpi:income:retail:trade:wpi	YUGOSLAV ECONOMY WORSENED IN 1986, BANK DATA SHOWS   National Bank economic data for 1986   shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate   rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and   the value of the dinar fell.       The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct   higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three   months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard   currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.       Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in   dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars   based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.       Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the   convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344   mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a   deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency   area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.       Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while   industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data   showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.       Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.       Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages   were too high given the level of productivity.       Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the   last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.       Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money   supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9   billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of   foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs   abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.       The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard   currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the   Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar,   46.2 pct.
earn	ANZ BANK SETS ONE-FOR-TWO BONUS ISSUE   Australia and New Zealand Banking   Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> said it will make a one-for-two bonus issue   from its asset revaluation reserve to shareholders registered   June 2.       The proposed bonus and an increase in authorised capital to   one billion one-dlr par shares from 600 mln will be put to   shareholders for approval at an extraordinary general meeting   on May 26, the ANZ said in a statement.       The issue will absorb about 230 mln dlrs of the 260.9 mln   standing in the asset revaluation reserve, it said.       The bank said that by lowering the dividend rate it expects   to maintain the value of dividend payout on the enlarged   capital at about the level of its last full year ended   September 30. The group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln   dlrs in all for that year.       Shareholders will also be asked to approve changes in the   bank's articles of association to allow it to offer shares in   lieu of the interim dividend at a discount of five pct to the   market price.       The group is the latest to announce a tax-free bonus issue   ahead of dividend imputation, effective July 1.

The Beijing-Santiago Copper Tube Co involves an investment   of 9.93 mln dlrs and will, on completion, have a production   capacity of 5,000 tonnes of copper tubes a year, it said.       It said Chile will supply copper at preferential rates to   the venture, whose equipment comes from &lt;Wednesbury Tube Co> of   U.K.       The agreement calls for joint Sino-Chilean management of   the venture for 15 years, the paper said.       It said the venture is the first economic cooperation   project between China and Chile, but gave no more details.       China is a major copper importer. Customs figures show it   imported 171,118 tonnes of copper and alloy in calendar 1986,   down from 355,652 tonnes in 1985.

It said exports over the period rose by 8.7 pct to 12.38   billion dlrs and imports by 8.9 pct to 14.64 billion for a   trade deficit of 2.26 billion, against a 2.06 billion deficit   in the same 1986 period and 1.78 billion deficit previously.       The growth was attributed to the strength of non-oil trade,   especially computers and computer parts, electronic components   and garments, it said.

However, total gross exports for the year declined by 5.6   pct to 35.9 billion ringgit from 38 billion in 1985 due to a   fall in major commodity exports and weak prices, he said.
acq	OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS   A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome   Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>   may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door   for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.       Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt   of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim   debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer   substantial payments to creditors will expire.       Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders   that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.       Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as   public noteholders in March after several months of delicate   negotiations.       TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debt   restructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker   Ltd said from Toronto.       Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow   creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet   to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to   cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.       "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that   even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that   Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"   said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in   Calgary.       TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome   was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed   refinancing packages, Gobert said.       The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome   since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders   to agree to a restructuring, he added.       "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain   any and all offers (for Dome)," Gobert said.       Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that   TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix   the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other   possible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention to   us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little   reluctant to come forward," he said.       Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal   offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a   confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.       Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions   with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other   unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and   financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including   TransCanada's.       Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price   for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.       However, he said not enough financial details are known   about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of   TransCanada's proposed offer.

Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing   in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain   some 1.085 billion stg.

trade	TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN   Member states of the European   Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which   they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open   its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.       Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC   countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the   willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese   government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.       However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as   EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.       Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to   an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could   raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.   Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.       The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations   entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed   to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of   the U.S.       The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's   trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in   March, up from 1.94 billion in February.       In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion   dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one   pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.       In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has   decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.       Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen   Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application   of French quality standards -- something EC states say often   happens to their own exports entering Japan.       Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese   banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,   because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in   competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.       However, British officials in London have said that the   government may have gone too far in implying that it would take   immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.       By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful   economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring   to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own   industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.       The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent   years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open   its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.       At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end   allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and   spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts   for the building of a new international airport, and to   simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.       EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but   often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff   barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.       They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the   EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.       One of the problems Britain could face if it were to   withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers   would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,   they point out.
earn	MORGAN CRUCIBLE SAYS PROSPECTS ARE ENCOURAGING   Morgan Crucible Co Plc &lt;MGCR.L> said the   prospects for 1987 were encouraging, with orders and sales   significantly up on last year in all divisions.       It said there were good opportunities for growth in both   existing and recently acquired businesses as well as for growth   by acquisition in related areas.       It earlier announced a 6.1 mln stg rise in pre-tax profit   to 24.8 mln stg for the year to December 28. Turnover rose to   242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.       Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in   the U.S., U.K. And Australian economies in the first half.       Currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one   mln stg, it noted.       Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector   improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results   were nonetheless disappointing.       Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed   defence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken   the necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was   now proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.       Morgan shares firmed two pence to 318p at 0905 GMT from   316p at Friday's close.

The rise reflected recovery in almost all sectors after an   exceptionally cold spell in January, the Bureau said, adding   that the highest rises were seen in the forest, chemical and   metal industries.

The Central Bank of Kenya set the shilling at 20.7449 to   the SDR compared with the 20.6226 rate in force since the last   devaluation on March 31.

grain:wheat	AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS   Australia could lose valuable wheat   markets through lack of availability if plantings for the   coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian   Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.       "If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove   true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its   valuable markets," he said in a statement.       Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB   spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that   farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut   back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.       However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be   cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were   facing enormous financial pressures.       He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln   hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about   16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting   intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.       If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in   plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed   with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling   wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.       "Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat   understand a decrease in production due to drought but they   will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to   decrease production," Condon said.       "If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export   income earner, governments and government authorities will need   to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing   viability of the wheat industry," he added.       Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,   Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.

meal-feed	DUTCH FEED COMPOUNDER STARTS CASE AGAINST EC LEVY   A major animal feed producer, Cehave   NV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against the   application of the European Community grain co-responsibility   levy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feed   trade association, Het Comite, association chief executive   Peter Pex told Reuters.       Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the   court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. "However,   that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to   refer questions on the interpretation and application of the   levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg," Pex added.       Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take   account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a   compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in   its own national currency than it received down the chain from   the original producer of the grain.       "We would like the Business Administration Court in the   Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether   the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,   has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also   whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,"   Pex said.       "It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,   but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option   even though it could take years," Pex added.       Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the   grain levy because the bill the company received from the   commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins   and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a   legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.       Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on   the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case   brought by the Association of European Animal Feed   Manufacturers, FEFAC.
corn:grain:groundnut:oilseed:rice	CHINA RAISES GRAIN PURCHASE PRICES   China has raised the state purchase   prices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from April   1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official China   Commercial Daily said.       The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northern   provinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50   kg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the   price to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen.       The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10   southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg.       The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11   provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest   China has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave no   more price details.       It said local authorities must inform farmers of the price   increases before farmers begin planting, to encourage   production of grains and oilseeds.       Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow   grain because they can earn more from other crops.
cocoa	WEST GERMAN COCOA GRINDINGS WITHIN EXPECTATIONS   West German first quarter cocoa   grindings, which rose 2.9 pct from the same 1986 quarter, were   within expectations, trade sources said.       They described the results, announced Saturday, as normal   and unspectacular, considering that the grind in the fourth   quarter was rather high and some was carried over into the   first quarter.       Grindings rose to 55,190 tonnes from 53,643 in the first   1986 quarter. A spokesman for the Confectionery Industry   Association said that West German grindings are expected to   stay relatively high in comparison to other West European   countries.

bop:cpi:gnp:jobs	INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY   The five leading West German economic   research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the   domestic economy will expand this year but revised down   forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.       The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen   predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross   national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared   with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast   three pct 1987 growth in October last year.       Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin   and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.       The joint report said that the estimates of economic   development made by the DIW and Ifo were "markedly less   favourable" than those of the other three.       The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a   slow start to the year. "In the second half of 1987 there will,   however, only be a weak upward movement," they said.       The two institutes said external economic factors which   were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would   dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw   exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no   marked improvement in the course of the year.       The other three institutes, however, wrote: "The decline in   demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not   indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing."       They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate   uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.   But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled   but only put off. "It can be presumed that the braking actions   (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year."       They added: "The domestic prerequisites for a continuation   of the economic uptrend are still favourable."       These three institutes said diminishing external burdens   combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in   demand and production could be expected by the spring.       However, this projection was clouded by risks including the   further development of the mark against the dollar.       Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that   while exports would continue to be the weak point of the   economy in 1987, "there is good reason to believe that exports   will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during   the course of the year." They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall   in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.       The three more positive institutes saw private consumption   rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,   while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.       They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but   predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in   1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.       All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in   unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the   jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23   mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in   work of about 200,000.       These three institutes said new jobs would be created   mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in   the context of job creation measures. The construction industry   was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980   but they predicted either no rise in employment in the   manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.       The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only   in the tertiary sector, while "the number employed in the   manufacturing industry will decline."       The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to   2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.       They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58   billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a   current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks   and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around   100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.       The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to   rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five   predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.

interest:money-fx	SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSITS SURGE ON U.S. RATE RISE   Saudi riyal interbank deposit rates   surged across the board as banks tried to build long positions   in anticipation of a further rise in U.S. Interest rates,   dealers said.       They said traders expected riyal deposits to follow the   recent strong rise in eurodollar rates sparked by fears of a   tighter U.S. Monetary policy to halt the dollar's slide.       "There was a wave of panic buying early in the morning as   people tried to cover gaps and build long riyal positions," said   one dealer. As a result, riyal deposits were strongly bid and   traders scrambled for any available offers.       One-way trade focused mainly on the fixed periods but short   dates also rose, dealers said. Spot-next and one-week deposits   climbed to 6-5/8, 1/8 pct from 6-3/8, six on Sunday.       One-month deposits rose to 6-1/2, 3/8 pct from 6-1/4, six   and three-month deposits climbed to 6-3/4, 5/8 pct from 6-9/16,   7/16. Six-month deposits also firmed to 7-1/8, seven pct from   7-1/16, 6-7/8 on Sunday.       The spot riyal was steady at 3.7500/03 to the dollar after   quotes of 3.7498/7503 yesterday.

The setting was the highest since October 8 as gold built   on Friday's gains, which had been based on the weakness of the   dollar and fears of a trade war between the United States and   Japan.       It opened slightly firmer at 433.50/434.00 and moved up   steadily during the morning supported by commission house and   trade buying, dealers said.       Dealers said there was resistance around 440.00 but with   sentiment still firm some traders believe the rally may even   take gold as high as 500 dlrs.       Platinum was fixed this morning at 583.50 dlrs an ounce, up   from Friday's close of 578.50/580.50, and also the highest   setting since October.
acq	BORG-WARNER AGREES TO BUYOUT BY MERRILL LYNCH FIRM   Borg-Warner &lt;BOR> Corp, facing an   unwanted offer from GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion   dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch   Capital Partners Inc>.       Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a   definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the   new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per   share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of   Borg-Warner common stock.       The offer will be followed by a merger in which each   remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and   54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated   discount debentures.       As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly   owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said   members of management do not plan to participate in the   transaction, but they will retain their positions with the   company.       A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds   19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.       GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.       Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to   sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo   security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.       Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for   about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed   a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the   stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup   values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and   speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.       In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the   Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their   shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its   advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.       James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,   said, "We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction   with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the   employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its   strong presence in the Chicago community."       Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,   which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject   to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing   arrangements.       The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or   51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.       Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to   provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in   subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.       Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with   commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the   financing required to complete the transaction.       The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in   the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying   cash interest after five years.       The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option   for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at   102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.       The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity   of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in   the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before   maturity.       Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50   dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per   share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first   convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.       The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its   poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,   effective immediately.
wpi	U.K. MARCH PRODUCER PRICES RISE 0.3 PCT   The price index for sales of   manufactured goods in the U.K. Rose a provisional, unadjusted   0.3 pct in March after an identical rise in February,   Department of Trade and Industry figures show.       The index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturing   industry fell a provisional and unadjusted 1.1 pct after a 1.7   pct fall in February.       The Department said the year-on-year rise in producer   prices in March was a provisional 3.7 pct, compared with a   provisional 4.2 pct increase in the year to end-February.       The index for output prices, non-seasonally adjusted, was   put at a provisional 149.7 in March after 149.3 in February.       The index for input prices, also not seasonally adjusted,   was set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6.       The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and March   was mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricity   costs and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, the   Department said.       The Department said these falls were only partly offset by   a rise in prices of home-produced food manufacturing materials.       The seasonally adjusted index for input prices showed a 0.2   pct rise between February and March.

The field, in the southern sector of the Gulf of Thailand,   is currently operated by U.S. Oil company Texas Pacific Oil Co   Inc, a unit of Canada's Seagram Co Ltd &lt;VO.N>. Thailand's state   oil company &lt;Petroleum Authority Thailand> (PTT) also holds a   major stake in the field.       PTT wants to develop the field and has asked Statoil to   consider co-development if the field's licence is renewed.       PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with   Texas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's   holdings in the field.       "PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific.   When this is done, we have said we are interested in taking   over a 30 pct share in the field," Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen   told Reuters.       Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal   of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has   estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost   of some 700 mln crowns.       Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower   reserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little   interest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its   upgraded reserve estimate for the field.       The field's reserves could be sold domestically through   Thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to   electricity, the sources said.       Sources would not say which field Statoil is considering.

gnp	WEST GERMAN INSTITUTES CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS   The five leading West German economic   research institutes said the government should do more to   stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of   tax cuts planned for 1990.       In their joint spring report the institutes were divided   about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct   expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national   product grew 2.4 pct last year.       But the report said all the institutes believed that "more   must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional   jobs can be created."       The institutes said any step which improved basic economic   conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. "From this   point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be   brought forward."       The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion   marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from   the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.       However, the institutes criticised the government, not only   for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of   its financing had been left open.       The government has not specified how the remaining 19   billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,   though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.       The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had   caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what   exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a   quick decision from the government.       They also said the government should reduce tax   preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a   restriction of state spending and called for no increase in   value-added tax.       The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing   subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.       They referred specifically to a doubling of special   writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a   package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this   as an increase in subsidies.       The institutes said total subsidies, including tax   preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen   further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it   should be possible "despite ... Major political difficulties" to   finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.       The institutes said that if the government raised value   added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the   positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.       The report also noted that the government was progressing   only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and   said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim   for more competition, it said.

Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential   buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70   pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N>, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>   which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd   &lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.       Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another   proposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with a   third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a   statement.       The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,   but did not identify the companies involved in talks.       TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline   operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common   and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which   would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer   is to Dome management, not to shareholders.       Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,   totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.   It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.       Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement "violated   the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered   into with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed to   prevent Dome from considering other proposals.       It said the TransCanada bid "seems to require favourable and   substantial taxation concessions from the federal and   provincial governments." But Dome added that its management and   financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.       TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he   was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied   that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (Dome's   statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to   authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce   it," he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the   other bidders, or the terms of other offers.       Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the   Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at   5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.
money-fx	BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS   The Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion   yen in deficit financing bills today through 51-day repurchase   agreements maturing June 3 to help absorb a projected money   market surplus, money traders said.       The operation will raise the outstanding supply of the   bills to a record 4,800 billion yen.       The yield on the bills for sale to banks and securities   houses from money houses will be 3.8999 pct compared with the   two-month commercial bill discount rate today of 3.8750 pct and   the two-month certificate of deposit rate of 4.13/00 pct.       The traders estimated the surplus today at about 1,800   billion yen.       They said it is mainly due to 1,300 billion yen of   government tax allocations to local governments and public   entities and to excessive banking system cash holdings due to   continuous large central bank dollar purchases.
alum	LME CLARIFIES NEW ALUMINIUM CONTRACT DETAILS   The London Metal Exchange (LME) has   issued a note clarifying details on its new high grade   aluminium contract, in response to questions from members   following the announcement of the contract, due to start June   1.    All deliverable shapes of aluminium under the high grade   primary aluminium contract (minimum 99.7 pct purity) will also   be deliverable against the standard primary aluminium contract   (min 99.5 pct), the LME said.       Sows will not constitute good delivery against the standard   contract until September 1, and 99.5 pct purity sows are not   good delivery and cannot be placed on LME warrant.       The dollar quotation for the high grade contract will be in   multiples of one U.S. Dollar but carries may be made at 50   cents for even tonnages only.       Singapore, which is the first port warehouse outside Europe   to be used as an LME delivery point, will be used for high   grade metal only and the rent imposed by owners Steinweg will   be 1.05 U.S. Dlr a tonne per week, the LME said.       The LME Board, in response to representation from the   trade, agreed to annul from LME contracts the minimum weight   requirements of 450 kilos for T-bars and 250 kilos for sows,   effective for high grade on June 1 and for standard on July 24.

The central bank had placed buy orders at that level and   prevented the dollar from falling when it came under heavy   selling pressure from investment trusts and trading houses,   they said.       However, the intervention failed to boost the U.S. Currency   significantly from the 142.20 yen level, they added.       The dollar was trading around its midday rate of 142.30   yen. It had opened here at 141.85 yen.
money-fx:trade	CURRENCY MOVES MAY BE HURTING WORLD TRADE   Japanese trade figures are seriously   challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group   of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates   are the key to smoothing world trade problems.       Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say   they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies   are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan   shrinking?       What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down   made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,   fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of   world trade recession?       U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar   fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five   pact in New York.       The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct   more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them   economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.       Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising   rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined   only 11 pct against the yen.?       Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely   interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar   must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?       At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can   only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.       "I don't know and I don't think anyone knows," said Hugh   Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.       "What I do know is that Community exporters are making a   hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there   is money to be made in Japan," he added.       But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.   Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade   practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as   agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable   checking and customs procedures for car imports.       Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the   face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they   blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.       "We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,"   said a senior official, who declined to be named. "We like to   refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort."       Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the   Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita   repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to   understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. "The real   issue is the inability of major sectors of American and   European industry to compete not only internationally but even   in their home markets," Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz   Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

wpi	U.K. PRODUCER PRICES SEEN MOVED BY TECHNICALITIES   U.K. Producer price data for March were   roughly as expected after taking into account technical factors   which affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analysts   said.       The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonally   adjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged from   February and close to the average for the last six months.       The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct   in February.       But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips and   Drew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a   rise in excise duties which affected the index in March last   year.       He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into   the monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in April   would take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.       Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input   prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors   such as a fall in industrial electricity costs.       Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were   slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling   had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.       Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep input   costs down over the next few months, although Tinker added that   last year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the   year-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to   rises in the index rather than falls.
gnp	BANGEMANN REJECTS CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS   West German Economics Minister Martin   Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leading   economic research institutes for early introduction of a major   tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.       In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint   spring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call for   bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --       "The government points out that the positive effects for   growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget   deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered."       Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned   for 1988 had already been increased.       Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987,   with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct   growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.       Bangemann said "The government, agreeing with the majority,   sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for   exports expressed by the minority."       He said there was reason to believe that export demand   would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because   of a further increase in world trade.
gnp	ITALIAN GDP ROSE 2.4 PCT IN 1986 FOURTH QUARTER   Italy's Gross Domestic Product, calculated   at 1980 prices, rose 2.4 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986,   compared with the same period in 1985, National Statistics   Institute ISTAT said.       ISTAT said in a statement that GDP growth in fourth quarter   1986 was zero compared with the preceding quarter. Italy's   budget ministry said last month that 1986 GDP rose 2.7 pct in   real terms from 1985.       Imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26,361 billion lire,   down 1.4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6.6 pct from   the third 1986 quarter, ISTAT said.       Istat said exports totaled 23,190 billion lire in the   fourth quarter, down 4.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter   and down 6.7 pct from the third quarter in 1986.       Fixed investments were 23,438 billion lire in the fourth   quarter, down 0.7 pct from the preceding quarter and up 1.1 pct   from the comparable 1985 quarter.
dlr	G-7 SEEMS WORRIED MARKETS IGNORE COORDINATION   Top officials of leading industrial   nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have   ignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they   believe they strengthened in talks last week.       Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the   markets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely   disrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the   policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,   Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.       Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to   reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a   statement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur   underscored that by saying: "I don't believe at all that the   Americans want a weaker dollar."       West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the   dollar's latest rapid descent "involves the risk -- now already   a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,   leading to a renewed rise in interest rates."       But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared   the market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they   could do until the economic picture changed, and currencies   settled into a stable pattern as a result.       Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's   semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher   U.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid   descent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.       Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told   television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving   the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.       "It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would   adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would   drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not   (into) recession, into slower growth," he said.       Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the   dollar, Balladur said: "When a currency is maintained   artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is   not healthy."       And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to   recession, he said.       Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of   life, Balladur said, "there may be adjustments of course in one   or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system."       But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he   might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.       U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it   understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.       "The United States and the six major industrial countries   are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these   agreements," Baker told the meetings.       Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which   wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further   decline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to   stabilizing currencies at current levels.       Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February   22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed   to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight   protectionism.       West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate   domestic demand and lead a global upturn.       Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's   promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.       The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major   action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable   currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at   the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.       The Paris accord said, "currencies (are) within ranges   broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given   the policy commitments summarized in this statement."       Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially   against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent   with the agreement. "The ministers and governors reaffirmed the   view that around current levels their currencies are within   ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals," last week's   statement read.       Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were   focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.   Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan   rather than prospective policy changes. European monetary   sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant   business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit.
gnp	INSTITUTES SEE NO WEST GERMAN RECESSION   The five leading West German economic   research institutes, which have revised down their forecasts   for 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany,   their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.       The institutes were divided in their spring report on   forecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth and   two seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.       Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said,   "None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the   beginning of a recession." He added, however, that exports   remained the weak point of the economy .       Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further   encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.       Arthur Krumper of Munich's Ifo institute, which with the   DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of   the economy, said, "The braking effects (on the economy)   produced by external factors will remain considerable for most   of the year."

acq	CRAZY EDDIE &lt;CRZY> SETS DEFENSIVE RIGHTS   Crazy Eddie Inc said its board has   adopted a defensive shareholder rights plan and said it has   received "friendly inquiries" on its acquisition.       It said under the plan, shareholdrs of record as of April   21 will receive a right to purchase under certain circumstances   at a price of 42 dlrs 0.01 preferred share for each common   share held.  The rights will expire April Nine.       The company said the rights would be exercisable 20   business days after a party were to acquire 20 pct or more of   Crazy Eddie common stock or announce a tender or exchange offer   that would result in ownership of 30 pct or more.       Crazy Eddie said if a party owning 20 pct or more of its   stock were to merge into it or if a party were to acquire 40   pct or more of Crazy Eddie stock, right holders other than the   acquiring party would be entitled to acquire common shares or   other securities or assets with a market value equal to twice   the rights' exercise price.       If after a party acquired 20 pct or more of its stock Crazy   Eddie were acquired or 50 pct of its earnings power or assets   sold, rightholders other than the acquirer would be entitled to   buy shares of the acquirer's common stock worth twice the   rights' exercise price, the company said.       Crazy Eddie said if a party were to acquire 30 pct or more   of its common stock and then fail to acquire Crazy Eddie within   180 days thereafter, rightholders would be entitled to exchange   their Crazy Eddie common stock for subordinated notes of Crazy   Eddie maturing either one year or, above a certain dollar limt,   five years after issuance.       Crazy Eddie said adoption of the plan is not in response to   any known effort to acquire control of it.  But the company   said it has become aware of some "possible accumulations" of   its stock has has received some "friendly inquiries."

money-fx	ZAMBIA'S KWACHA FALLS AT WEEKLY AUCTION   The Zambian kwacha fell at this week's   foreign exchange auction to 18.75 kwacha to the dollar from   last week's 16.95, the Bank of Zambia said.       The rate was the lowest since the auctions resumed two   weeks ago under a new two-tier exchange rate system worked out   with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.       The Bank of Zambia said it received 370 bids, ranging from   13.00 to 20.75 kwacha, for the six mln dlrs on offer. One   hundred and thirty-five bids were successful.       A British High Commission spokesman said Britain would put   eight mln stg into the auction at a rate of one mln a week as   soon as Zambia reached a full agreement with the IMF.       The money could be spent only on goods produced and   supplied by British firms, excluding luxuries and defence   equipment, the spokesman added.
interest	U.S. SENATE LEADER CALLS FOR INTEREST RATE CUTS   Senate Finance Committee Chairman   Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) called on major industrial countries to   make a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cut   interest rates.       "I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to be   trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that   are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,"   Bentsen told NBC Television's "Meet the Press."       Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take "billions off   the debt service of the Latin countries" and help ease   protectionist pressures in the industrial countries.       Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to   revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.       "You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,   enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation   there," he said.       Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told the   same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not   fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.       "I think that more does have to be done there in   negotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs   (newly industrialized countries)," he said.       Darman said such negotiations with newly industrialized   countries were underway privately.       Bentsen predicted Congress and the White House would agree   on a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22   billion dlrs in new revenues.       The Texas senator said a series of excise taxes would be   considered by Congress, including an extension of the telephone   tax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes.       Bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that it   would not happen without President Reagan's support.       Darman called for a "top level negotiation" between the White   House and Congress on a budget compromise that would include   asset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-class   entitlement programs, "a reasonable, steady rate of growth in   defense" and reform of the budget process.
acq	OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS   A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome   Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>   may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door   for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.       Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt   of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim   debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer   substantial payments to creditors will expire.       Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders   that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.       Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as   public noteholders in March after several months of delicate   negotiations.       TransCanada's proposal "amounts to a quasi debt   restructuring," oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker   Ltd said from Toronto.       Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow   creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet   to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to   cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.       "The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that   even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that   Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,"   said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in   Calgary.       TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome   was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed   refinancing packages, Gobert said.       The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome   since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders   to agree to a restructuring, he added.       "I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain   any and all offers (for Dome)," Gobert said.       Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that   TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix   the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other   possible buyers from making an offer. "By drawing attention to   us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little   reluctant to come forward," he said.       Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal   offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a   confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.       Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions   with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other   unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and   financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including   TransCanada's.       Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price   for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.       However, he said not enough financial details are known   about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of   TransCanada's proposed offer.
acq	SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW>   Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has   raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each   from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking   to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.       In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his   MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration   period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had   been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he   had received a "negligible" number of shares in response to the   offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.       Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln   common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a   primary basis.       Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan   as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders   would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject   to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in   June.       The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln   dlrs in debt to finance the payout.       Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the   amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to   give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on   the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New   Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.       He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all   of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a   merger transaction.       Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares   he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,   would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.       He said he still has received only a "negligible" number of   shares in response to his tender.       In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in   the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April   8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to   increase the price of his offer.       Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in   place.       Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered   to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing   dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding   Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.       He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a   syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr   margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for   further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to   an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the   purchase of shares under the offer.       Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,   each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,   or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into   Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an   independent investment baking firm.       He said "To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares   are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a   combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value   of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars."       Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to   Caesars' recapitalization.       Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming   officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory   process required for regulatory approval, a process that it   already underway in New Jersey.       He said his offer has been extended based on the likely   duration of the regulatory process.       He said he intends to further extend the offer if the   approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

bop:cpi:gnp	PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS   Portugal's economy, which has been   enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,   may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest   government crisis, analysts said.       But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco   Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment   as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European   Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.       Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was   toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.       The centre-right administration had made economic growth   reform a priority in its 17 months in office.       In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current   account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and   inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.       Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability   were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued   growth had not been badly shaken.       "The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is   now less dependent on the political situation," said Fritz   Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.       "The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet," economist   Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.       Businessmen have identified political instability over the   last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting   economic progress.       The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974   revolution.       Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain   buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge   in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely   underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.       Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of   Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,   predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth   would remain at similar levels this year.       But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies   and could slow economic development.       Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end   of the month, can either call early elections or form a new   government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated   parliament.       Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick   elections as the best solution. "There is a good chance that a   majority government could result from early elections,"   Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro   Ferraz da Costa said.       He said they were optimistic this could mean the   continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies   introduced over the last year.       The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but   the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls   say they could win an overall majority.       A PSD majority would also open the way for more   wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and   possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.       Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties   of blocking key economic reforms.       The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results   were more the product of favourable international conditions   such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD   policies.

nat-gas	COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> SEEKS CONTRACT COST RECOVERY   Columbia Gas Transmission   corp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if   its costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts.       Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary   said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a   proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent   purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.       Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial   ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative   filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to   include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or   consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing   and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.       The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover   about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales   commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on   recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,   beginning April 1, 1987.       Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline   commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.       The company said it orginially sought to include these   costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in   almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were   not related to take-or-pay buyout costs.       It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April   10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay   buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing   under the Natural Gas Act.       As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,   Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price   paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs   per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April   1985.       The pipeline said Southwestern producers account for 46 pct   of its total available gas supply this year.
cpi	HUNGARY RAISES PRICES IN EFFORT TO CURB DEFICIT   Hungary has announced sharp price   increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of   its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.       The official MTI news agency said the government decided   consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state   spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average   18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.       The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated   economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for   imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive   hard currency, the diplomats said.       The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect   the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in   other East Bloc states, notably Poland.       MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,   with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also   announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including   higher pensions and family allowances.

Foreign exchange reserves rose by 9.4 mln francs to 33.12   billion.       Sight deposits are an important measure of money market   liquidity in Switzerland.       The National Bank said banks repaid around 5.8 billion   francs of traditional central bank credit taken out to meet   their end-of-quarter liquidity requirements. This was partially   offset by new swap arrangements.       Bank notes in circulation fell 440.2 mln francs to 24.48   billion while other deposits on call at the National Bank --   mainly government funds -- fell 840.5 mln francs to 941.5 mln.

earn	GOODYEAR &lt;GT> PREDICTS FIRST QUARTER NET   Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said it   expects to report earnings from continuing operations of over   one dlr per share on 71.3 mln average shares outstanding.       In last year's first quarter the company lost 60.0 mln dlrs   or 55 cts per share on 108.4 mln shares outstanding, after a   110.8 mln dlr writedown of oil reserves of its Celeron Corp   unit.       Goodyear said it will report first quarter results April 27.       Goodyear chairman Robert E. Mercer also told the annual   meeting that unless there is a major downturn in the economy,   it expects to work its debt down to normal levels in three   years through its restructuring and cash flow from improved   margins.       The company set up its restructuring program to fend off a   hostile takeover attempt by Sir James Goldsmith.  As part of   the restructuring, Goodyear executed a major stock buyback   program that resulted in an increase in its debt.

trade	TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN   Member states of the European   Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which   they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open   its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.       Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC   countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the   willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese   government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.       However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as   EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.      Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to   an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could   raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.   Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.       The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations   entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed   to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of   the U.S.       The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's   trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in   March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
trade	EC COULD DECIDE ON JAPAN TRADE MOVES IN LATE MAY   The European Community (EC) has   effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its   market to imports before it decides on possible tough   retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.       They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26   to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.       The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of   member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC   pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are   "adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market."       Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing   stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese   exports.       The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be   discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers   on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare   proposals for possible retaliatory action.       They said the commission has powers to take some limited   action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese   exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being   diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.       In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to   prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a   result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges   them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.       Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown   steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March.

IBM said net income fell to 785 mln dlrs or 1.30 dlrs a   share from 1.02 billion dlrs or 1.65 dlrs on about 1.8 pct   fewer shares outstanding.       While total sales and income rose 5.5 pct to 10.68 billion   dlrs from 10.13 billion dlrs, costs and expenses rose 12.1 pct   to 9.61 billion dlrs from 8.57 billion in the quarter, the   computer maker said.       The company said it continues to take actions to make it   more competitive, including cost and expense reduction   measures.       "Although the worldwide economic situation remains   unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"   IBM said in a statement.       "In addition to the increase in first quarter shipments, we   have announced new offerings in our large processor and   personal computing product lines," it said.       "We have yet to fully benefit from our recent product   announcements, retirement incentives and other resource   balancing measures, and we expect these actions will have a   more significant impact as 1987 progresses," the company added.       It said it expects more than 12,000 U.S. employees to take   advantage of the retirement incentives announced last year.       Pretax earnings fell 27 pct to 1.34 billion dlrs from 1.83   billion, IBM said. Pretax margins slipped to 12.5 pct in 1987   from 18.1 pct in 1986, it said.

cpi:gnp:money-supply	GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY   Four of West Germany's five leading   economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary   growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.       But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,   echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said   the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not   necessarily threaten stability.       The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which   three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in   GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.       The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in   view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has   shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price   rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.       Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may   seem exaggerated, they said.       "But it has often turned out in the past that the price   climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into   a restrictive policy," they said.       The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are   less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.       The four institutes disputed the view that monetary   expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic   investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market   investments following lower interest rates.       "Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of   central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a   smaller expansion of money supply," they said.       A return to growth and stability did not require   spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with   open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid   an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.       The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be   focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of   uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic   weakness other factors should be taken into account.       Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts   and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation   speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat   in itself to price stability.       The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth   reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the   falling mark.

grain:wheat	USDA CHANGES LOW PROTEIN WHEAT TERMINAL PRICES   The U.S. Agriculture Department has   lowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard red   winter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a   senior USDA official said.       USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas   City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32   cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy   administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural   Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.       The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red   spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.       In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard   red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to   be identified said.       The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,   Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at   Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.       The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll   activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon   last week and will be effective today, he said.       Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums   on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat   prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein   premium would remain unchanged.

The meeting had been postponed from its original date of   May 14 in order to let management review recapitalization   options, it said.       In addition, Coopervision said operating income in its   current fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show an   improvement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs and   its year ago quarter.       Income from continuing operations was not immediately   availalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which it   reported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs.       At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference,   Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previously   announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for   shareholders.       He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its   second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35   dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of his   position.       "The stock dropped six dlrs in three days after Boesky sold   his position and has never recovered," Montgomery said. The   company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.       Montgomery further told the conference, "Don't be an   investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery   in operating or net income in 1987 and 1988."       "Our concentration is on maintaining or increasing market   share in our core businesses this year and next, regardless of   the impact to the bottom line," he said.

It said Reebok filed a registration statement with the   Securities and Exchange Commission for the offering of six mln   shares of Reebok common. Reebok will sell three mln shares and   Pentland will sell 1,404,866 shares, reducing its stake in   Reebok to 18.1 mln from 19.5 mln shares.       After the offering, Reebok will have 56.1 mln shares shares   outstanding.       Pentland said the amount of the capital gain from the sale   depends on the offering price for the Reebok shares to be   negotiated between it, Reebok, and the other selling   stockholders who will offer about 1.6 mln shares of Reebok   common, and the underwriters.       Pentland said proceeds from the offering will be used by   Reebok to retire bank debt incurred in its acquisition of AVIA   Group for about 180 mln dlrs. Is said that afterwards, Reebok   will have bank credit lines available for general corporate   purposes, including possible acquisitions.       Reebok's stock was selling at 45-1/2, up 1/8. At that   price, the 1.4 mln Reebok shares Pentland will sell are worth   about 64 mln dlrs and the three mln shares Reebok will sell are   worth about 136.5 mln dlrs.       Pentland said it will use proceeds to fund growth and   possible acquisitions.       Pentland said 4,500,000 shares of Rebbok will be offered in   the U.S. by a syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc and   1,500,000 shares will be offered outside the U.S. by an   international syndicate led by Kidder.       It said the U.S. underwriters have been granted an option   to buy from certain selling stockholders up to an additional   900,000 shares to cover overallotments.

The sale excludes certain real estate assets of Joske's and   Cain-Sloan, which Allied estimates have an aggregate value of   30 mln dlrs based on current market conditions.       Joske's has 26 stores in Texas and one in Arizona.   Cain-Sloan has four stores in Nashville. Joske's is the largest   unit Allied has slated for sale in its restructuring.       Allied Stores Corp, a subsidiary of Campeau Corp, was   acquired by acquired by the Canadian developer last year.       Robert Campeau, chairman of Allied, said "this is a   terrific start to our disposition program which is proceeding   well ahead of schedule. This sale will fulfill the requirements   under our bank agreements to sell certain assets by June 30 and   give us additional flexibility in the disposal of the remaining   divisions being sold."        Allied Stores is required to pay 200 mln dlrs in bank debt   by June 30. There had been some doubts on Wall Street that the   company could meet the payment.       A Campeau source said, "We believe this cash sale puts us   in a very strong negotiating position to maximize the proceeds   Allied can receive from its other divisions."       "Allied was able to put itself in a position where it knows   it will be able to meet the June 30 payment schedules," the   source said.       About 1.1 bilion dlrs in Allied assets had been targeted   for sale by Dec. 31, 1988 to pay for the aquisition of Allied   by Campeau.       Allied will be taking bids for its other divisions.   Targeted for sale are Bonwit Tellers, Garfinckel's, Dey's,   Donaldson's, Herpolsheimer's, Heer's, Miller's, Miller and   Rhoads, Pomeroy's, Catherine's, Plymouth Shops, and Jerry   Leonard.

NCR Corp plans additional new product announcements this   year, it said without elaborating.       NCR earlier said first quarter profit increased to 61.5 mln   dlrs or 65 cts share from 50.2 mln dlrs or 51 cts share in the   prior year. NCR's 1986 full-year earnings rose to 336.5 mln   dlrs from 315.2 mln dlrs in the prior year.       NCR said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from   strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in Europe   and Pacific marketing groups.       Growth in U.S. revenues also improved, the company said.   First quarter revenues increased to 1.12 billion dlrs from   960.8 mln dlrs in the prior year.

Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management   made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were   by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president   and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not   know the names of the president and controller, and could not   immediately comment on the release.       Foster said the amount involved in the "discrepancy" is   about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net   after tax due to an "improper recording of job costs over a   period of several years and continuing through part of the   first quarter of 1987."       Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.   The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not   "likely to be significant" but the amount to be charged to   prior periods had not been determined.       Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln   dlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.

trade	TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS   Taiwan announced plans for another round   of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade   talks with Washington which officials described as a move to   help balance trade with the United States.       Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's   Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of   products included 60 items asked by Washington.       "The move is part of our government efforts to encourage   imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United   States," he said.       He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet   that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,   apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut   by between five and 50 pct.       The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday   and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting   on April 20, he added.       Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700   foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its   growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's   largest trading partner.       Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and   pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade   deficit with Taipei.       Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6   billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It   widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78   billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.       Today's announcement came before a departure later today of   a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of   trade talks with U.S. Officials.       The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last   night he was leaving with "a heavy heart," meaning that he would   face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist   sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus   with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.       Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.   Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,   purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,   import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.       "I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from   our talks with the U.S.," he said without elaborating.
grain	BULGARIA, ROMANIA GRAIN CROP SEEN LESS FAVORABLE   Current prospects for this year's   grain crop in Bulgaria and Romania appear less favorable than   in 1986, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Belgrade   said in a field report.       The report said the assessment was based on travel in the   two countries from March 30 to April 4.       It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected   following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the   prolonged winter temperatures this spring.       However, in general plant development was at least three   weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied   greatly by regions, the report said.       Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and   especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about   65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good   condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others   varied considerably, the report said.       Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and   uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those   fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.

crude:ship	SOVIET TANKERS SET TO CARRY KUWAITI OIL   Kuwait has agreed to charter tankers   from the Soviet Union in a move to protect its oil exports   through the Mideast Gulf, diplomatic sources said.       They said the agreement followed months of talks with the   Soviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exports   after Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels in   retaliation for Kuwait's backing for Iran's war enemy Iraq.       Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially   to reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait's 22-tanker   fleet.       The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow to   provide a naval escort for its own vessels, but "the idea of   protection is implicit," one said.       They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the past   to unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq were   known to have sailed under escort. So far, none of the Soviet   ships are known to have been attacked by Iran. Diplomats said   they expected the chartered Soviet tankers to sail between   Kuwait and Khor Fakkan on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coast   a short way outside the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the   Gulf.
earn	CHEMICAL &lt;CHL> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, EXPENSES   Chemical New York Corp said its   first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed   1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.       Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln   dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the   Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in   lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.       A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs   from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was   mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in   consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.       Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,   Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or   4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.       Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of   medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not   resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the   whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.       Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on   non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended   interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest   income by 1.5 mln dlrs.       Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs   from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from   3.96 pct.       This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a   reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation   of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and   a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's   cost of funds.

earn	NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK USA 1ST-QTR NET RISES   National Westminster Bank USA said   higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial   increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in   first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported   a year earlier.       The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of   income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.       Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with   91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to   middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some   of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.       Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0   mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses   was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.       Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the   end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs   of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.       The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for   the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced   by about 4.9 mln dlrs.

earn	TALKING POINT/IBM &lt;IBM>   International Business Machines Corp   has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said   the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop   a two-year earnings slump.       "I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I   have been in a long time," said PaineWebber analyst Stephen   Smith.       "But they're not out of the woods yet," he added.       At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily   topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an   even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.       Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's   performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full   recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be   felt until later in the year.       These include the success of IBM's new personal computer   line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,   which will begin volume shipments in July.       In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its   early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will   emerge as the year progresses.       Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was   relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than   he has been for nearly a year.       "Although the worldwide economic situation remains   unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"   Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher   first-quarter shipments. "We remain optimistic about the   prospects for both the industry and IBM," he said.       "Akers was most encouraging," said PaineWebber's Smith.       A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe   computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected   first-quarter results, analysts said.       "Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in   March," after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of   Washington-based Weil and Associates.       Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called   the Sierras, "bailed out the whole quarter," Weil said, adding,   "If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year."

earn	IRVING BANK &lt;V> 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL   Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop   in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the   result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in   Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.       Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs   from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share   dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.       Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of   Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net   income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.       Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln   dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on   these loans during the remainder of 1987.       Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the   trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,   although these were partly offset by increased trust income,   profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities   gains, the bank said.       The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from   185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was   21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.

The overall January deficit of 14.8 billion dlrs will be   revised, but the February figure will be a final one, officials   said.       Previously, the initial monthly figure has had to be   revised in subsequent months because of the time lag between   the report and the compiling of final estimates on imports and   exports.       The reporting of the February trade data was delayed   several weeks to permit gathering latest figures on imports and   exports to give a clearer picture of the monthly trade balance.
acq	REVLON &lt;REV> AND MACANDREWS AND FORBES TO MERGE   &lt;MacAndrews and Forbes Group> and   Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV> said that they have entered into a   definitive mergewr agreement where MacAndrews will acquire   Revlon at 20.10 dlrs per common share in cash.       MacAndrews said it increased its offer to purchase all   Revlon common shares to 20.10 dlrs a share, from its April 1   offer of 18.50 dlrs a share.       Following consummation of the offer, a unit of MacAndrews   will merge into Revlon and each remaining share will be   converted into the right to receive 20.10 dlrs per share in   cash, the companies said.       Revlon said its board of directors unanimously approved the   merger agreement.       MacAndrews and Revlon also said they have reached a   settlement with the plaintiff in the pending litigation   challenging acquisition of the shares by MacAnrews.       The companies said the tender offer and withdrawal rights   will expireon Tuesday April 28, unless extended.       MacAndrews said it will promptly file revised tender offer   material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel   Burnham Lambert Inc is acting as dealer-manager for the offer,   the companies said.       Revlon currently has about 42 mln shares outstanding. The   current offer price is about 782 mln dlrs, a company spokesman   said, up from the previous offer of 720 mln dlrs.       On April 1, MacAndrews and Forbes, owned by Ronald   Perelman, offered 18.50 dlrs a share for the 63 pct of Revlon   shares he did not already own.       Since the offer was made over a dozen shareholder lawsuits   were brought against Revlon alleging the original offer was too   low.       But, the companies said these lawsuits have been settled in   the amended offer.

This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported   on operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior to   entering a joint venture with United Telecommunications &lt;UT> in   July 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of   Sprint.       Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0   mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago.       Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, "we expect US   Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic   migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance   telecommunications.       The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as   well as higher operating costs related, in part, to the   fraudalent use of the network.       Operating income of its telephone operations, which account   for 91 pct of the total, rose eight pct to 736.0 mln dlrs.    Revenues from telephone operations rose eight pct to 2.9   billion dlrs.
acq:earn	GOODYEAR &lt;GT> TO SELL CELERON   Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said it   expects to sell its Celeron Corp oil and gas subsidiary for   about two billion dlrs in about two months.       After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer,   Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said    Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a   share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the   same year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a   share from continuing operations.       Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying   Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.       Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost   complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,   Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves   would not be sold separately from the pipeline.       Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for   Celeron was too high, Mercer said "There is no fire sale going   on here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable   operation throughout the year."       Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was   based on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase   last year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover   bid.

Addressing a gathering of analysts and institutional   investors, Marshall also said that analysts' estimates of its   first qtr earnings - 50 cts to 55 cts per share - were "in the   ballpark."

He also said the first quarter estimates were 70 pct higher   than 1986's first quarter net of 29 cts per share.   Marshall attributibuted the first quarter earnings growth to   several factors, including sustained demand in Aristech's major   domestic markets and continued growth in exports.       Aristech plans to spend approximately 200 mln dlrs over in   capital investments over the next three years, Marshall added.

acq	GAF &lt;GAF> SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR> BID   GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner   Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to   be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.        Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for   4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch   Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for   89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and   securities for the balance.       Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.       "I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in   with another bid," said one analyst, who values the company at   51 or 52 dlrs per share.       GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of   Borg-Warner's stock.       "You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up   the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have   to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking   at it - that it's worth more," Pershing and Co analyst Richard   Henderson said.       Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.       GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill   Lynch officials did not return phone calls.       Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman   sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics   business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as   telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.       "Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical   operation these days," said Henderson.       "He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he   does not like to get pushed around," said Henderson.       GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover   of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF   did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its   investment in Carbide.       Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its   Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer   and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would   give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.       "It's a win-win situation," said one analyst.       One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be   forthcoming shortly.       "I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this   book," he said.       Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,   protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security   guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.       Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows   GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it   would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per   share.       "I think there's a probability he goes up in price," said   Rose.       Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman   would do. "Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."       "Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical   enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank," Rose   said.       Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add   earnings momentum to GAF. "I worked out that paying as much as   50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if   they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities," said John   Henry of E.F. Hutton.       Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986   operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion   dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net   earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

carcass:livestock	EC MEAT DIRECTIVE DEADLINE SEEN FLEXIBLE   U.S. officials said they held out   little hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw a   controversial meat inspection requirement, due to go into   effect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cut   off their exports.       But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.   plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year   provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.   Agriculture Department.       The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will   require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC   inspection standards beginning April 30.       The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting   the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.       At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln   dlrs in 1985.       The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes   in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing   to use of wood.       Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,   one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved   without further review. USDA would have to certify that the   plants had corrected the deficiencies.       All remaining plants with a history or potential of   shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more   significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before   further EC review.       Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat   Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal   trade retaliation petition by April 30.       An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft   petition.       An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said   U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,   but that "the chances of that are not too good at this time."       However, there is the "expectation" in U.S. government and   meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow   shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from   U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring   their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the   USTR official said.
interest:money-fx	U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON   Major U.S. banks may lift prime   lending rates again within days due to recent increases in   their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is   nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.       In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most   banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to   7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own   cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.       "A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,"   said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.       Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is   justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and   the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a   percentage point.       He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage   points since last October until it fell below one point and   triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.       "We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon   as this week," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.       "We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the   near future," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.       "Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding   costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"   said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.       However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime   because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan   demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain   recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.       Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift   short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He   said "if there is widespread belief money market rates will   stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."       Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a   dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar   fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders   said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.       In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to   stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.   interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.       Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions   on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said "it has become   clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure   in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."       Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest   rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation   that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.       That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the   market than most economists had expected.       On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small   amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements   with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another   high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct   today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr   round of customer repurchase agreements.       "The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is   offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"   said Jones of Lanston.       "The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the   need to defend the dollar," Jones said. He believes it is   merely shading policy toward restraint now, "but to have a   major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy   overtly at some point."       Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by   becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within   four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.       Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might   well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to   further aid the dollar.       Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on   30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate   may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.       "The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening   policy to defend the dollar," said Leslie of Discount Corp. He   said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.   Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures   abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.

"We've no plan to bid," Blair told reporters after a speech   to a business group, although he stressed that Nova and 57   pct-owned Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO> were interested in Dome's   extensive Western Canadian energy holdings.       "But being interested can sometimes be different from   making a bid," Blair said.       TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP> yesterday bid 4.30 billion   dlrs for Dome, but Dome said it was discontinuing talks with   TransCanada and was considering a proposal from another company   and was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored   to be offshore.       Asked by reporters if Dome should remain in Canadian hands,   Blair replied, "Yes. I think that we still need to be building   as much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I   think it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadian   management."       He said he did not know who other possible bidders were.       Blair said that any move to put Dome's financial house in   order "will remove one of the general problems of attitude that   have hung over Western Canadian industry."       He added, however, that the energy industry still faced "a   couple of tough, tough additional years."       Asked about Nova's 1987 prospects, Blair predicted that   Nova's net profit would rise this year to more than 150 mln   dlrs from last year's net profit of 100.2 mln dlrs due to   improved product prices and continued cost-cutting.

The stock has fallen 2-1/4 to 56-1/8 so far today, after   the news about the suit was released this morning.       "It's potentially a big suit and investors feel that its   not good to go against regulators," Kenneth Ch'u-K'ai Leung, a   Smith Barney analyst said.       "What investors are actually saying by selling off some BFI   shares is the cloud over this industry is the threat that the   EPA will get tough on waste management companies," Willard   Brown, senior analyst for First Albany Corp.

Brown said if the suit were settled for 10 mln dlrs   it would have an impact on Browning Ferris earnings.

gold	HOMESTAKE &lt;HM> MULLS BUYING ORE RESERVES   Homestake Mining Co is considering   acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's   exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reuters   in an interview.       "We are looking at more options to acquire more reserves   rather than just exploration," Conger said adding, "the move to   consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's   acquisitions policy."       Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120   mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,   Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which   have not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an   acquisition, he said.       Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be   about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said   exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than   last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas   exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6   pct.       Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about   the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.       However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin   reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400   ounces due to start-up production problems.       He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400   U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.        IN 1986, company earnings were based an average market   price for gold of 368 dlrs an ounce.       Conger said a three pct change in gold prices represents a   12 cts a share impact on earnings but he declined to give a   specific forecast for 1987's first quarter, due to be released   in 10 days, or for full year 1987 results.

earn	HONEYWELL &lt;HON> CITES COST CUTTING FOR GAIN   Honeywell Inc said a gain of   20.1 pct in its 1987 first quarter operating earnings was the   result of cost cutting efforts which began last year.       Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings   rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or   79 cts in the same period a year ago.       Better operating results in each of the company's three    sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due   to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and   the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit   with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.       "Our first quarter results show clear benefits of our   restructuring," chairman Edson Spencer said. "All of our   businesses are producing better results than last year, even   though we do not see significant improvement in the external   market environment," he said.       Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,   with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in   addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.       Domestic industrial automation and control orders were   modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.       Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and   control business were flat in the U.S. and up in international   markets, it said.       International orders increased, with the greatest strength   in Europe, Honeywell said.       The company said that by year-end 1987, it intends to   complete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a five   mln share buyback program which began in 1986.

gold	HOMESTAKE MULLS BUYING ORE RESERVES   Homestake Mining Co is considering   acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's   exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reuters   in an interview.       Conger said, "the move to consider acquisitions represents   a change in the company's acquistions policy."       Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120   mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,   Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which   have not been drawn on and could be used to finance an   acquisition, he said.       Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be   about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs.       Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly   higher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and   gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's   9.6 pct.       Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about   the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.       However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin   reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400   ounces due to start-up production problems.       He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400   U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.

In an article headlined, "Gulf oil sources say Middle East   production up 1.4 mln bpd," it warned OPEC's official prices   could face fresh pressure from international oil companies   seeking cheaper supplies.       It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other   producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor   did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts.       "The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under   fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the   European and American markets," the daily said.       The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in   March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some   members had raised output last week. It gave no details.       "Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was   able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and   producing over quotas has begun anew," it said.       The sources warned that "maybe the (price of a) barrel of   oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if   there is no control on supplies," it said.       "The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel   may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure   OPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,"   it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift   from Qatar unless it gave price discounts.

The company said the change came after talks with the   Securities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement   in considering the five mln dlrs collectible.       In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American   Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,   making its loan loss provision less than required.       The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still   feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986   was adequate and that it has considered all relevant   information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr   receivable.       But, it said continued disagreement with the SEC staff   would not be in its best interest.

orange	U.S. AGENCY RULES AGAINST BRAZIL ORANGE JUICE   The U.S. International Trade   Commission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department to   impose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozen   concentrated orange juice.       The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in   its final ruling on the matter.       Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce   Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an   anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen   concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator   said.       The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have   injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already   ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to   1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision   last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.       The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on   imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since   Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.       Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --   Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.       Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.   supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,   the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of   Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.       Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon   tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.       An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final   report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.       Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and   transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries   dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing   duties, Vastagh said.       He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,   including three major shippers, would be affected by the   decision.

crude	TEXACO &lt;TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED   Texaco Inc has re-established some key   oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for   protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said   Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.       "Several companies say they are willing to start trading,"   Yates told Reuters in an interview.       The company last week had stated that a number of domestic   and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil   shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.   Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.       Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks told   Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco   said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.   Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits   to cover transactions, it said.       The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose   from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme   Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over   the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.       The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's   plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.       "Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they   could," Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court   ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting   supplies.       "It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an   avalanche," he said. "Supplies were cut to the point where we   could not run the system at anywhere near capacity."       He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in   jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages   by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton   said.       It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,   canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,   Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and   Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards.       The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> last   week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today   said, "a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on   supplying. They had cancelled last week."       He declined to identify the company.       &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil   company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also   halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.       But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the   Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key   supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the   Algerians, he added.       Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter   11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines   and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.       "It will be business as usual for Texaco," said Martin   Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer   and Traub.       "Creditors are a nervous bunch of people," he said. "But   when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and   will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company."       But other officials at Texaco were not immediately   available to say whether discussions were being held with its   banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

A GAF spokesman said the company asked for the information   in order to enable GAF to fully evaluate its alternatives.       The spokesman also confirmed that GAF did raise its bid to   48 dlrs cash from 46 dlrs per share on Friday.       Merrill is offering 48.50 dlrs per share cash for 89 pct of   Borg-Warner, and a package of cash and securities for the   balance.       The transaction with Merrill Lynch will take Borg-Warner   private in the form of a leveraged buyout. Merrill Lynch does   not intend to sell Borg-Warner assets, but it may be forced to   do so in financing the deal, said sources familiar with the   transaction.        Borg-Warner has said its management is not a participant   in the transaction, but managers will retain their positions.       The investors involved with Merrill include pension funds,   insurance companies and other institutional investors, sources   said.       Analysts believe GAF, which owns 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner,   will raise its offer.       That speculation drove Borg-warner stock up 1-3/8 to 49-5/8   in heavy trading. GAF closed at 49-5/8, off 3/4.
crude	ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT   A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said   in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the   United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its   crude oil without breaching OPEC accords.       Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi   National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community   magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.   "The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its   customers in accordance with market conditions...And take   necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said.      "The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on   adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control   production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to   stabilize the market," he added.       OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln   bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.       Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future   depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.       Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was   ADNOC's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexible   pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market   environment."       He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average   609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales   totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.       In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil   and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.

acq	DOME &lt;DMP> BENEFITS FROM TAKEOVER SPECULATION   Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted   their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock   markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the   debt-heavy company.       Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and   gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock   Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high   as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome   has normally moved by only a few cents per day.       TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr   Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but   Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still   talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.       Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed   to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday   stressed that its bid is "a Canadian solution to the financial   difficulties of Dome Petroleum."       "The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont   &lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadian   interest in 1975 and could be getting back in," said Wilf Gobert   of Peters and Co Ltd.       David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British   Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite   BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent   of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own.       Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said   in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks   with Dome.       Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,   Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.       Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as "awfully   optimistic," given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome   shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10   dlrs Canadian per common share.       Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred   shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which   would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada   would own 80 pct.       However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the   potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. "The   TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,"   he said.       Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is "at the   upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."       The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87   billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another   one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to   secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a   certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.       Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion   Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on   several years ago when oil prices were high and the company   wanted to expand.       "There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable   of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that   basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"   Gobert said.       Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it   is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds   reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion   cubic feet of natural gas.       The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres   of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the   heart of Canada's oil industry.      Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of   land across Canada.      The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs   Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of   2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the   largest ever by a Canadian company.
interest	U.S. BILL AUCTION RATES AVERAGE 5.98, 6.08 PCT   The U.S. Treasury said its weekly   auction of three-month bills produced an average rate of 5.98   pct, with a 6.08 pct rate on six-month bills.       These rates compared with averages of 5.53 pct for the   three- and 5.63 pct for the six-month bills sold last week.       The bond-equivalent yield on three-month bills was 6.17   pct. Accepted bids ranges from 5.92 to 5.99 pct and 60 pct of   the bids at the high, or stopout rate, were taken. For six   months, the yield was 6.38 pct and the bids ranged from 5.98   pct to 6.10 pct with 48 pct of the bids accepted.       The Treasury said it received 25.99 billion dlrs of bids   for the three-month bills, including 1.2 billion dlrs in   non-competitive bids from the public. It accepted 6.6 billion   dlrs of bids, including 2.1 billion dlrs from the Federal   Reserve and 180 mln dlrs from foreign and international   monetary authorities.       Some 24.7 billion dlrs in bids for six-month bills were   received, including 832 mln dlrs in non-competitives. The   Treasury accepted 6.6 billion dlrs, including 1.8 billion dlrs   from the Fed and 1.2 billion dlrs from foreign and   international authorities.       The average price for the three-month bills was 98.488 and   prices ranged from 98.504 to 98.486.  The average price for the   six-months bills was 96.926, and prices ranged from 96.977 to   96.916.       The average yield on the three-month bills was the highest   since 5.99 pct on June 30, 1986.  The average yield on the   six-month bills was the highest since 6.13 pct on June 23,   1986.

crude	TEXACO FILING ADDS UNCERTAINTY IN OIL MARKET   U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc's   filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is   adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but   opinions are divided on the impact to the market.       "The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today," said   one trader. "Everyone is talking about it, assessing their   company's situations in relation to Texaco," he added.        Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are   concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies   under the bankruptcy filing.       However, others were less worried. "The first paid will be   the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the   shipping industry," one New York trader said.       "If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its   refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,"   he added.       Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.   bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement   with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally   interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.       However, others were less worried. "The first paid will be   the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the   shipping industry," one New York trader said.       "If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its   refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,"   he added.       Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.   bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement   with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally   interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.       "There is some reluctance to trade with Texaco but no great   change," said another trader, adding that traders are tending   toward prudence in their dealings with the company.       Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or   letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco   on an open line basis, he said.       Another trader, however, described today's activity as   business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because   no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in   bankruptcy.       Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco   filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange   might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins   for Texaco's trades.       New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden   declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is   is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as   a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower   allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for   companies that are in financial trouble.

acq	MERRILL TO GET 30 MLN DLR FEE IN BORG &lt;BOR> DEAL   Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER>   subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it   could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not   the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.       In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,   Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30   mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer   manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.       But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln   dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party   holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.       The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any   tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer   manager services or for break-up of the deal.       Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of   investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender   offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.       The company's board has approved the plan, which was   intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.       Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A   preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a   share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.       Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible   leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.       At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would   consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,   if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said   it was told the company had decided against a buyout.       But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a   share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.       Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner   management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it   was conditioned upon payment of the fees.       In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also   get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in   the tender offer.       Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner   as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their   positions.       But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is   considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of   subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.       All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130   mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.       Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt   of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.       To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to   borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln   dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of   non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch   and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to   Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of   subordinated discount debentures.       GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.

Diceon said Symtron management would continue running the   business, which would become a wholly-owned subsidiary.       Symtron had 1986 sales of about 20 mln dlrs.
crude	ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION   Ecuador will resume limited crude output   next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil   to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean   Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said.       CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador   would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in   northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in   preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to   neighbouring Colombia.       Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an   earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,   at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific   port of Balao.       It will take at least until the end of July to repair the   pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was   pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.       To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is   constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying   55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point   of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.       The original target date to resume limited crude output was   May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago   Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman   said.
cpi	NEW ZEALAND CPI RISES 2.3 PCT IN MARCH QUARTER   New Zealand's consumer price index,   CPI, which measures the rate of inflation, rose 2.3 pct in the   quarter ended March 31 against an 8.9 pct rise in the December   1986 quarter and a 2.3 pct rise in the March 1986 quarter, the   Statistics Department said.       For the 12 months ended March 1987 the CPI rose 18.3 pct   against 18.2 pct in 12 months ended December 1986 and 13.0 pct   in the 12 months ended March 1986, it said in a statement.       Nearly half the increase in the latest quarterly index was   contributed by the housing group, the department said.       The December quarter was significantly affected by the   introduction of a 10 pct value added goods and services tax,   GST, in October 1986, it added.       However, some GST charges not measured in the December 1986   quarter influenced the latest March quarterly figure, it said.       This is because of an unavoidable lag in price information,   particularly on housing, used cars and insurance on household   contents, it added.

The minister was not referring to the U.S. Trade data to be   released in Washington later today.       Miyazawa also said he told major industrial nations when he   was in Washington last week that present exchange rates are not   necessarily good. He had said earlier in Washington that   current exchange rates were within levels implied in the   February Paris currency accord.

acq	NO TALKS SET ON PROPOSED JAPAN TELECOM MERGER   No formal talks have been scheduled yet   among companies involved in a controversial proposal to merge   two groups seeking to enter Japan's international   telecommunications sector, an official from one group said.       "Nothing has been firmed up yet," said an official at   &lt;International Digital Communications Planning Inc> (IDC), one   of the groups set up last year to study competing against   &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which monopolises the sector.       Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, which holds a 20   pct share in IDC, has opposed plans to merge with rival group,   &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc>.       Under the plan, backed by the Post and Telecommunications   Ministry, Cable and Wireless and U.S.-based &lt;Pacific Telesis   International Inc> would become core companies in the merged   firm, with shares equal to those of the six major Japanese core   companies and seats on the board of directors.       Britain, angry over what it feels are moves to restrict   Cable and Wireless' role in the sector, views the issue as a   test case. The IDC official declined to specify what was   holding up the talks.       A spokesman for C. Itoh and Co Ltd &lt;CITT.T>, which holds 20   pct of IDC, said a meeting may be held later this week.
sugar	HAITIAN CANE PLANTERS PROTEST SUGAR MILL CLOSURE   About 2,000 sugar cane planters   marched to Port-au-Prince to protest against the closure of   Haiti's largest sugar mill and second biggest employer.       The Haitian American Sugar Company closed on Friday because   of a huge surplus of unsold sugar. The firm said Haiti has been   flooded with smuggled refined and unrefined sugar from the   Dominican Republic and refined U.S. Sugar from Miami.       The closure idled 3,500 factory workers and left 30,000   small cane planters with no outlet for their cane. The   protesters blamed Finance Minister Lesly Delatour for the   closure, saying his policies have hurt Haitian businesses.
alum	CHINA TO OPEN FIRST PHASE OF LARGE ALUMINIUM PLANT   China, a major aluminium importer, will   open the first phase of its biggest aluminium plant on October   1, the China Daily said.       The first phase of the plant, located in Qinghai province,   will have an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes of ingots, half   the capacity of the finished plant. It will turn out 4,000   tonnes in 1987, the paper said, but gave no more details.       Construction of the 510 mln yuan plant began in April 1984.       Customs figures show China imported 266,241 tonnes of   aluminium and alloy in 1986, down from 487,862 in 1985.
corn:grain	TAIWAN IMPORTS 210,000 TONNES SOUTH AFRICAN MAIZE   Taiwan imported about 210,000 tonnes of   South African maize between January 1 and April 13, the joint   committee of local maize importers said.       Under a three-year agreement signed last year, South Africa   will export 600,000 tonnes of maize a year to Taiwan.       A committee spokesman told Reuters the rest of this year's   quota will be shipped during the rest of 1987.
soybean:veg-oil	TAIWAN LIKELY TO BUY MORE U.S. SOYBEANS   A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for   soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan,   a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers told   Reuters.       He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the   cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.       The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987   soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he   said. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.       Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the   U.S. And the rest from South America.       The spokesman said the increase in imports from the U.S. Is   in line with government efforts to reduce Taiwan's trade   surplus with Washington, which rose to 3.61 billion U.S. Dlrs   in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago.       "The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (who   want) to boost their exports to Taiwan," Steve Chen, country   director of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters.

It said sorghum output in calendar 1986 was 5.34 mln   tonnes, down five pct from the 1985 level, and prices on the   free market rose in January to 0.42 yuan per kg, up 14 pct on   January 1986.       It said sorghum acreage in 1987 is six pct lower than in   1986. Sorghum accounts for 40 pct of the raw materials needed   by China's breweries, it added but gave no more details.

bop	SOUTH KOREA TO CHANGE POLICIES TO AVERT TRADE WAR   South Korea has decided on major changes   in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing   the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a   trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim   Mahn-je said.       Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports   could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase   nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which   means abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign   debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.       Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the   current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight   billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion   dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation   and rationalising exports.       He said Seoul would try to limit its current account   surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few   years, although trade volume would continue to grow.       "This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP   (gross national product) from the current five pct level to   three pct by 1991," he added.       Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign   debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end   of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5   billion dlrs at end-1986.       "But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to   remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower   than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs," he said.       The policy change was announced two days before the   scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige   for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.       South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral   trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from   4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.       Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing   in South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion   dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln   dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose   36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.       The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5   billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw   materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.       "The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at   1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are   considerable incentives given to increase imports," Koo said.       Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency.   "It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean   currency continues to rise in value," he said.       He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the   dollar gradually, but added "We do not believe in rapid one-shot   changes in the value of the won."       The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six   pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.

grain:trade	U.S. URGES JAPAN TO OPEN FARM MARKET FURTHER   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng   has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help   Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist   pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.       Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic   Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister   Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help   Japan as well as the United States.       The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by   Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.       However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was   already the world's largest grain importer.       Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and   depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food   requirements in 1985.       Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm   products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on   beef, citrus products and rice.       Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of   self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice   because potential production is higher than domestic demand.       The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of   rising production by exporting countries, he added.       Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product   output with expensive programs, Maki said.       Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions   on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks   at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative   Clayton Yeutter will join.
corn:grain	60,000 TONNES CORN SMUGGLED INTO PHILIPPINES-PAPER   At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240   mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past   few months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting an   official in the National Food Authority (NFA).       The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage   and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have   jeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which was   aimed at saving foreign currency.       The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as   saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes   against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.       Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150   hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn   worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.       The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician,   as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total   inventory at the end of the January/June crop season is   expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.

The newspaper said: "News of the unexpectedly large 15   billion deficit helped batter the dollar's value on foreign   exchange markets and boosted U.S. Interest rates.       "However, the new report went largely unnoticed by financial   markets since such a downward revision in the deficit is a   monthly occurrence."       The Washington Post said: "By law, the department must first   publish what a top commerce official agreed are misleading   trade figures and then wait 48 hours before putting out the   more accurate ones."       No one was immediately available at the Commerce Department   for comment on the Washington Post report.

Junichiro Koizumi, the head of the LDP committee working   out the plan, said the phrase should not be taken as implying   an immediate cut in Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate.       "The LDP generally believes that there is no need for a   further discount rate cut at the moment," he said. But Koizumi   said the LDP does not rule out a rate cut if necessary in the   future.       Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a press   conference on Wednesday that the central bank does not have any   intention of easing credit conditions.

The average wholesale-price related inflation stood at 5.2   pct in March this year against 5.1 pct a year ago, the Ministry   said in a statement.       It said wholesale prices of cement, textiles and jute fell   in 1986/87, compared with the previous year, but milk, cereals   (mainly wheat and rice), fruits and vegetables, edible oils,   tobacco and fertilisers were costlier in 1986/87.
trade	JAPAN DETAILS PLAN TO STAVE OFF TRADE PROBLEMS   Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)   has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an   increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of   the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.       The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's   official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five   years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior   LDP officials said at a press conference.       LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain   the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.       Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro   Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.       Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the   tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.   However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe   will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.       The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by   the government will probably include the purchase of super   computers, LDP officials said.      specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage   flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.       The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and   lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.       The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and   welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial   nations in Washington last week, they said.       The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several   packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be   unveiled by the government in late May.
reserves:trade	CHINA TRADE DEFICIT FALLS SHARPLY, RESERVES RISE   China's trade deficit in the first   quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same   1986 period, customs figures show.       Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau,   quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28   billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.       He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and   materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only   350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a   result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their   level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.       Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs   at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.       Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved   incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain   more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.       He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose   35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46   billion. Exports to Japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and   imports 24.4 pct to 2.14 billion.       Exports to the U.S. Rose 23 pct to 640 mln dlrs and imports   fell 26.7 pct to 840 mln. Exports to the EEC rose 35.1 pct to   770 mln dlrs and imports fell 3.8 pct to 1.5 billion, he said.

trade	JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS   Basic reform of Japan's protected farm   sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to   domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade   surplus, securities analysts said.       The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and   quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and   sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they   said.       "In economic terms, reform would be a plus," said Christopher   Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.       The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices   twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,   The analysts said.       Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the   average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross   national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.       Reducing these prices could increase household spending   power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on   products which would have a more direct impact in boosting   domestic growth, it added.       "There's a lot of slack," a U.S. Government official in Tokyo   said. "All that money could be spent on something else."       Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector   amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent   estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37   billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.       Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm   on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential   development would also give a boost to domestic spending,   economists said.       "Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the   expansion of domestic demand," wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor   at Kyoto Gakuen University.       Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform   to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic   restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the   farm sector. Employers groups also want change. "If you really   want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to   raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices," Bumpei   Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'   Associations told a recent press conference.       External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek   removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade   deficits with Japan.       But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well   entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.       Although the full-time farm population is falling and there   are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban   constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on   farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several   city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.       The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform   plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,   the analysts said.       Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the   traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for   national food security, they said.       Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to   import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms   aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.       Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific   pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.
money-supply	JAPAN SEES HIGHER MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH THIS QUARTER   The Bank of Japan said it forecast   Japan's broadly-defined M-2 money supply average plus   certificates of deposit (CDs) will rise by about nine pct in   the current April-June quarter against 8.5 pct a year earlier.       Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in   January/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year   earlier, it said.       The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in   floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift   to private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1,000 billion   yen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways.
cpi	OECD CONSUMER PRICES RISE IN FEBRUARY   Consumer prices in the countries of the   Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)   rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct   year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique.       The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the   effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working   their way out of the index. The February increase was less than   Janauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for   the later months of 1986.       Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in   January was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year.        Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January's   1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine   pct lower than a year earlier, it said.       Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in   February, in line with previous months, although there has been   some acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain.       Among the leading seven industrial countries, consumer   price inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct, followed by   Canada at 4.0 pct, Britain at 3.9 pct, France at 3.4 pct, the   U.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates   of 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.
carcass:orange:rice:trade	LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng   opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware   his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus   markets is likely to be rejected.        But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to   Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an   international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import   protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open   its markets.       "(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but   they are not going to give us anything," Lyng said.       U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions   during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions   would be unveiled later this month, they said.       "If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime   Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him," when he   visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.       Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by   partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.       A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week   requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses   such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying   Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.       Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for   beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would   like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.       He cited the example of a California company which   transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to   circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than   the value of the animal, he said.       U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion   Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow   from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986   quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan   has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.       Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to   eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by   April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually   be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because   liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese   mandarin orange industry.       The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because   imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And   Japanese officials have said.      Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy   surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,   but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.      Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,   including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in   Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain   minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.
trade	JAPAN DETAILS PLAN TO STAVE OFF TRADE PROBLEMS   Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)   has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an   increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of   the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.       The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's   official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five   years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior   LDP officials said at a press conference.       LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain   the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.       Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro   Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.       Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the   tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.   However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe   will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.       The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by   the government will probably include the purchase of super   computers, LDP officials said.       According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solve   specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage   flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.       The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and   lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.       The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and   welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial   nations in Washington last week, they said.       The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several   packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be   unveiled by the government in late May.
trade	BALDRIGE TO LAUNCH FAR EAST TRADE DRIVE   U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm   Baldrige leaves on Saturday on a 10-day trip to the Far East to   help spur U.S. Trade and improve business relations with China,   South Korea and the Philippines, U.S. Officials say.       Baldrige will also stop in Hong Kong to meet British   officials and local U.S. And Hong Kong businessmen.       The U.S. Last year had major deficits with three of its   Asian trading partners -- South Korea 7.1 billion dlrs, Hong   Kong 6.4 billion and China 2.1 billion. The deficit with the   Philippines was 800 mln dlrs.       Baldrige will meet South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan and   Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae on Monday to discuss opening South   Korean markets to more U.S. Goods.       Baldrige will be in Peking from April 21 to 24. He will   meet Zheng Tuobin, minister for foreign economic relations and   trade, attend a meeting of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on   Commerce and Trade and address a management and training   organisation.       However, U.S. Officials said a chief purpose of Baldrige's   visit would be to discuss relaxed U.S. Rules for transferring   modern technology to Chinese industries.       In Hong Kong, Baldrige will hold meetings on April 27 with   Governor David Wilson and Trade and Industry Secretary Eric Ho,   as well as addressing the American Chamber of Commerce.       U.S. Officials said Baldrige will meet Philippines   President Corazon Aquino on April 28 to show continued U.S.   Support for her government and to discuss steps it could take   to improve the atmosphere for American investment.       He will also will meet Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin and   Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion.
grain:trade	U.S. URGES JAPAN TO OPEN FARM MARKET FURTHER   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng   has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help   Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist   pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.       Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic   Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister   Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help   Japan as well as the United States.       The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by   Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.       However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was   already the world's largest grain importer.       Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and   depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food   requirements in 1985.       Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm   products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on   beef, citrus products and rice.       Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of   self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice   because potential production is higher than domestic demand.       The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of   rising production by exporting countries, he added.       Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product   output with expensive programs, Maki said.       Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions   on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks   at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative   Clayton Yeutter will join.

trade	REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS   President Reagan today is to   announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to   retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair   practices in semiconductor trade.       The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of   Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of   experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.       Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs   on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors   and television sets to power tools and photographic film.       The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some   20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa   Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.       In his March annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to   full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide   American industry with free and fair trade opportunities."       He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the   pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world   markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.       U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March   announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.       White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  "we   do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of   action that requires meaningful action."       Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,   with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.       About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.       Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to   retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.       He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent   negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that   existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.       Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was   as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not   need any new trade legislation.       The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring   the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the   results showed up.       U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of   Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and   Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the   Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.       Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would   file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade   (GATT).       It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had   violated the regulations of the global trading group and would   approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.       U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would   retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with   the United States.

acq	AMOCO &lt;AN> MAY BUY DOME &lt;DMP>, REPORT SAYS   Amoco Corp is apparently the successful   bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a   published report.       The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the   negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with   TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3   billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.       No financial details about the Amoco offer were available   and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco   had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.       However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome   could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and   Mail said.       Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for   comment.       Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome   said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused   to identify them.       Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and   Exxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in   Canada.       British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>   have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.       In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by   the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,   the only Canadian company in the bidding.       Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want   to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government   gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to   encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and   officials have said.       A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run   afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is   asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is   trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,   analysts have said.       A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign   oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.       Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,   with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based   Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco   Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.

The offer closes next Friday. The ministry said in a   statement 51 pct of the bank's capital had been sold to a solid   core of large investors, including insurance companies and   Michelin subsidiary SPIKA, for 145 pct of the public offer   price. Ten pct of the shares have been reserved for employees,   who get a five pct discount increased to 20 pct if they keep   the shares for two years.       Employees also get one free share for each one bought, if   the shares are held for at least one year.       Small investors would receive one free share for every 10   bought, with an upper limit of five free shares per investor,   and on condition the shares are held for at least 18 months.       The state-owned capital of BIMP comprises 2.51 mln shares.   The bank is being sold to the public as part of a sweeping   programme to privatise 65 state-owned groups over five years.       In a separate statement, the ministry said last week's   privatisation offer of 1.07 mln shares in &lt;Banque du Batiment   et des Travaux Publics> (BTP) was 65 times oversubscribed.
interest	BUDGET CHIEF MILLER WARNS FED ON INTEREST RATES   White House Budget chief James   Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might   "overreact" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by   raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession   next year.       "Our greatest danger is overreaction," Miller told newspaper   reporters yesterday. "I'm concerned about the Fed's   overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data   showing a substantial fall in the money supply."       Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published   in the New York Times today, were accurate.       Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to   signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he   said could have "political consequences."       The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to   the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential   and congressional elections next year.       "My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep   soup, and there is no question about it," he said.       Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax   revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.       Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central   bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of   bolstering the dollar.       Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve   Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further   declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize   global growth prospects.       U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to   stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that   could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist   pressures in the United States.
ipi	BANK OF FRANCE SEES PICKUP IN INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY   The Bank of France said in its latest   monthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup in   industrial production registered in March to gather steam over   the next few months.       Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,   partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost   earlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to   a firming of domestic demand.       "New progress is expected in all main sectors except capital   goods where production will remain at its present level," the   report added.       The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March trade   balance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade for   the first time since June 1982.       While the automobile industry remained unchanged from   previously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and   was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic   appliances. Semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in all   sectors. Construction and civil engineering, boosted by a rise   in public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in all   sectors continued to slow.
wpi	ITALIAN WHOLESALE PRICES UP 0.2 PCT IN FEBRUARY   Italy's wholesale price index rose 0.2 pct   month-on-month in February 1987 after increasing by 1.1 pct in   January, the national statistics institute ISTAT said.       The index, base 1980 equals 100, registered 173.1 in   February compared with 172.8 in January.       The February figure represents a decline of 0.2 pct   compared with February 1986 after a year-on-year decline in   January 1987 of 1.7 pct.
trade	YEUTTER SAYS JAPANESE CURB ALL BUT CERTAIN   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton   Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go   ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.       Asked in a television interview what the chance was for   Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese   electronic exports, he said "slim to none."       Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to   retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end   dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than   cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.       Yeutter, on the NBC program "Today," said the United States   did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop   the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.       He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials   they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take   time to monitor any compliance.       Asked how long that would take, he said "We want to see a   pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would   take a few weeks."       Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer   impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods   because the items selected are also readily available from   other countries and manufacturers.       He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.       "It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country   to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that   full well," Yeutter said.       He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but "that's more of a   paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any   adverse impact on U.S. trade."       Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor   issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit   later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.       He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a   major issue, would be productive but "I don't see any practical   way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his   visit."

alum	FORD &lt;F> DEVELOPING ALUMINUM CAR FRAME   Ford Motor Co said it is developing an   aluminum space frame for its Probe V concept car using extruded   stretch-formed aluminum that could lead to new techniques for   building production cars in the future.       It said the frame would reduce vehicle weight and cost   while maintaining structural integrity and crashworthiness. The   frame has fewer parts than conventional steel frames, Ford   said.  The company said the lighter weight would allow smaller   powertrains and suspensions, further reducing weight and   improving fuel economy.       Ford said in addition, extrusion dies cost 1,000 to 12,000   dlrs each, compared with hundreds of thousands of dollars for   steel stamping dies, and using extruded aluminum the number of   welds in a car could be reduced to about 40 from over 2,000.
trade	U.S. COMMERCE TRADE REPORT OMITS FREIGHT COSTS   The Commerce Department said on that   insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion   dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1   billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.       The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after   the initial trade report to issue a second report on a "customs   value" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance   charges from the cost of imports.       Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce   Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion   dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.       A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the   foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers   said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been   revised downward.       The Commerce department would like to have the law changed   to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.       "My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's   legislation that requires us to delay it two days," said Robert   Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.       "But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays   any attention to the second figure."       The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a   revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.       The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly   trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in   1979.       Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes   customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison   with other countries that reported their trade balances on the   same basis.       The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting   freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable   light for the Reagan administration.       Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to   eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.       "We're considering it," he said, "It's one of those dinosaur   laws and I think it's time has come."       The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting   freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable   light for the Reagan administration.       Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to   eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.

trade	JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING   The tough trade sanctions President   Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across   Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade   practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.       But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings   Institution, a think tank, said "a shot across their bow can   often result in a shot in our stern."       He said it left the United States open to retaliation.       The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered   on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress   that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,   and no new protectionist legislation is needed.       In the past year tough trade action had been taken against   the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer   and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,   patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.       White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the   tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a "serious signal"   to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.       Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,   television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor   an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at   less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The   tariffs were placed on items which were available from other   sources so there would be little effect on the American   consumer, Fitzwater said.       Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action   - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade   practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.       The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.       The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion   dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about   one-third of America's overall deficit.       But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West   Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the   president is ready to fight them all.       Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that "I regret   that these actions are necessary," but that the health and   vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to   American competitiveness in world markets.       "We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading   practices," Reagan added in the statement from his California   vacation home at Santa Barbara.       He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan   abided by the agreement.       U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -   which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he   already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.       The White House aide said of the tariff action, "it wasn't   done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade   practice."       The aide added, however, "on another plane, it was an   example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight   unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major   overall of our trade laws."       But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not   in the best interests of the United States, and that   negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.       "It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route," he   said, "because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in   trade."       Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for its   political impact across the country, and therefore its impact   on Congress."       He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."       But other analysts said it made little difference whether   the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,   and that the main point was that the trading partners were on   notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.       Spokesman Fitzwater said "we don't want a trade war," but the   imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when   it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.       Crandall said, "the administration is doing this for its   political impact across the country, and therefore its impact   on Congress."       He said, "I don't think it makes a lot of sense."

trade	YEUTTER ALMOST SURE JAPAN WILL NOT RETALIATE   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton   Yeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate   against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of   Japanese electronic goods today.       "I'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will   not provoke a retaliation on American products," Yeutter told   Cable News Network.       "Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with   the United States) to seriously entertain thoughts of   retaliation," Yeutter said.       Earlier today, Reagan    imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of   Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of   a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade.       Yeutter did say that U.S. farm products would be targeted   if Tokyo decided to hit back.       "If they (Japan) were to retaliate, it would probably be on   something like American agricultural products," he said.       "But I really think the chances of that happening are   between slim and none," he added.

Japan requested bilateral consultations in accordance with   Article 23-1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade   (GATT) in Washington yesterday.       Tamura said there was deep regret over the U.S. Measures,   which will impose 100 pct tariffs on about 300 mln dlrs worth   of Japanese imports of some small computers, colour television   sets and power tools.

money-supply	FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY   U.S. banking data released today are   too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary   policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the   Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,   economists said.       "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount   window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate   average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent   with a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago   Corp.       Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that   the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.       Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were   935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week   statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of   December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.       Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion   dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this   year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the   Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in   reserves than the Fed had anticipated.       However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed   is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than   witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have   forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.       First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week   ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,   partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the   proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to   pay annual income taxes.       As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the   reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.       Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion   dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists   said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the   projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to   add reserves too late.       Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently   left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which   to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists   said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos   outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add   even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.       "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as   much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"   said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.       McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting   discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,   equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.       After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not   tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,   economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging    overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the   statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.       Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that   the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's   figures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving   toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."       Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8   pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate   unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.       Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political   opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time   when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to   reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

coffee	MILD COFFEE GROWERS TO MEET IN GUATEMALA   A large group of "other milds"   coffee-growing nations will hold talks in Guatemala next month   to map their strategy for next September's meeting of the   International Coffee Organisation (ICO).

The main topic will be reform of what many producing   countries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export   quotas, Fernandez said.       He said Costa Rica would press for quotas "based on the   real production and export potential of each country in the   past few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic"   production levels rather than recent harvests and crop   estimates.

Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the   countries involved and the amounts expended, he said.

Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in   U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the   growth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are   not that good, he said.

crude	ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS   Ecuador will use a new pipeline link   with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,   Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.       The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to   allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5   by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,       Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its   OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts   contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador   mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.       The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after   signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation   of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling   will begin in September.       "The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only   for this emergency period but for the next five years, with   possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels   per day (bpd) will be pumped along it," Perry said.       Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels   through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents   per barrel during the first year.       The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will   run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle   oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the   Pacific port of Tumaco.       Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the   Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for   Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was "insignificant compared   with what we are going to earn."       OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before   the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln   dlrs per month, Espinosa said.

It said accumulated inflation for the first five months of   this year was 33.8 pct against 24.1 pct for the same period in   1986.       Inflation for the year ending May 1987 was 75.7 pct   compared to 76.8 pct for the year ending May 1986.
grain:orange:sugar	CHINA PROVINCE BECOMES GRAIN IMPORTER   The south China province of Guangdong is   importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and   other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain   to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.       The official magazine said the province's grain area fell   to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a   total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.       Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,   bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part   to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the   magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.       The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national   farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under   other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.       It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and   low productivity make grain the least profitable farm   commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1   hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan   from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.       It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only   gradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system.

gas	SINGAPORE PETROLEUM CO REVISES PETROL PUMP PRICES   Singapore Petroleum Co Pte Ltd will   revise pump prices of petrol from June 2, an official said.       Grade 97 octane with 0.15 gm/lead will be 96.8 cents/litre   against 94 cents previously for 0.4 gm lead. Grade 92 octane   will be 90.6 cents against 87.6 previously.       SPC's price revision follows the Ministry of Trade and   Industry's move to liberalise petrol pricing by allowing oil   companies to set their own pump prices.       New grades of petrol with lower lead content are sold in   Singapore from today in line with the Ministry of Environment's   regulations.
interest	BUNDESBANK REPORTED TO HAVE NO PLAN FOR RATE CUT   Bundesbank Deputy President Helmut   Schlesinger said the West German central bank had no plan to   cut its three pct discount rate, Nihon Keizai newspaper   reported.

He also told the newspaper he saw no need for large-scale   intervention in the foreign exchange market because exchange   rates are stable.        Earlier, Schlesinger told a press conference that the   Bundesbank would continue its policy of maintaining short-term   interest rates at a low level for currency stability.       He also said he was satisfied with the current dollar/mark   exchange rate but added that he was not certain if it was ideal   for the West German economy.
trade	SEOUL ANNOUNCES MORE TARIFF CUTS FOR U.S.   South Korea will cut import taxes on 50   items, including construction equipment, photographic film,   cigarettes and pipe tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus   with the United States, the finance ministry said.       The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points,   take effect on July 1.       This brings to 157 the number of goods on which import   taxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said.       The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington has   asked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added.       Today's announcement follows Saturday's removal of import   curbs on 170 products. For 46 of those products, the U.S. Had   had sought free access to the South Korean market.       "This is in line with the government's policy to limit our   trade surplus with the United States to help reduce trade   friction between the two countries," the official said.       South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 7.3   billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion in 1985. Officials said   the surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but Seoul   would try to hold it below eight billion dlrs.       The finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later this   month on a further 53 items, including acrylic yarn and   ethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to check   inflation.       The officials said the tariff cuts would contribute to   holding wholesale and consumer price rises at less than three   pct this year.
trade	U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE   The use of tariffs and quotas to   reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do   little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government   study said.       In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,   such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less   competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of   imported products that are re-exported in different forms.       "Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than   help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy," it said.       The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke   and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which   climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting   currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.       Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as   foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial   competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions   on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.       "Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level   of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find   that there have been no significant industry-specific changes   affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in   the overall trade deficit," the study said.       "To the extent any government action is needed to deal with   the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide   phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,"   the FTC study said.       Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts   were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report   said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some   domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.       It also said it found a "fairly direct relationship" between   the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting   currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic   demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign   consumer demand.       The study examined seven factors which have been commonly   blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and   trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of   investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development   in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil   prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.       In each case, the study found little or no evidence that   the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.

gold	RENISON GC AND CITY RESOURCES SET PNG GOLD VENTURE   Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd   &lt;RGFJ.S> (RGC) and explorer &lt;City Resources Ltd> have agreed in   principle on a joint venture to re-examine the Bulolo alluvial   gold field in Papua New Guinea, City Resources said.       City Resources would progressively earn up to 66.66 pct of   RGC's Prospecting Authority 585, which covers all the field, by   spending a total of 6.5 mln kina, it said in a statement.       It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in the   past, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in   tailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a   total of 2.1 mln ounces.       City Resources also said previous dredging was only carried   out to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values are   reported to at least 60 metres in the central part of the   Bulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres.       In its productive life, recovered average grade at Bulolo   was 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres of   gravel, it said. City Resources will act as operator.       The Bulolo field, in Morobe Province, was the first   successful gold mining operation of &lt;Placer Development Ltd>   after it was floated in Canada in 1926. It operated the field   until dredging ceased in 1967.

interest	WINDOW FOR BANK AID IN KUWAIT REMAINS SHUT   The Kuwait Central Bank kept its window   for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as   banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said.       The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher,   with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from   last Wednesday and hitting 20 pct.       There were few offers in a tight market and traders   scrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year   deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct   but there was little activity at the longer end of the market.       Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a   deliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and   stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market   nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf.       The central bank's move has been combined with a steady cut   in the dinar exchange rate.       Today's rate was reduced to 0.27939/73 to the dollar from   0.27758/92 on Wednesday before the four day bank holiday that   celebrated the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.

coconut:coconut-oil:copra-cake:meal-feed:palm-oil:veg-oil	PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX   Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)   chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this   month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community   (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.       "I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting   up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries   like the Philippines," Romero said in an interview.       He said he did not know how much support the levy had   within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed   to the tax were under pressure to change their position.       Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the   Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But   there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change   sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.       Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning   that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained   dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.       He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per   million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to   apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra   cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.       Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it   is not properly dried or ground.       Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in   London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC   standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,   but this was likely to take several years of research.       Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total   coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.       Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's   department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of   avoiding the copra process altogether.       "There are ways of producing coconut products outside of   copra," Romero said. "We can process fresh coconut without drying   the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process   coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to   the chemical root."       He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to   become more protectionist and he expected export prices of   coconut products to drop.       "In the long term we will be getting less and less for more   and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that," he   said.       With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up   production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil   output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.       "To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending   billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by   saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,"   he said.       Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to   stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a   high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,   and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.       Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year   coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall   after two successive years of good harvests.       He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to   add to the production fall, drought had affected output.       "Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the   prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep   prices stable is by processing, adding more value," he said.       Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by   planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.       "A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on   10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space," Romero   said. He said the government's proposed land reform program   would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they   had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.       "If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,   production and employment then it won't happen," he said.       PCA figures show about one-third of the country's   population is dependent on the coconut industry.       Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or   one-fourth of total agricultural land.
crude	PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE   Crude oil prices could remain around 18   dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on   output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an   official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos   (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.       Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of   international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared   to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself   for the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what was   originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than   envisaged a few months ago," he said.       He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of   production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the   18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been   envisaged might soften price levels.       The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in   Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.       "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in   terms of volume decisions," Lajous said.       A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted   output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is   always there as a possibility, he said.       "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I   expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and   discipline will be maintained," he said.       Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as   this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil   markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during   1987 if output remains under control.       He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that   increased production was not so important as long as incomes   would not be affected by the output, were "very relevant and   welcome from such a powerful producer."
acq	CONISTON GROUP TO CONTINUE BID FOR ALLEGIS &lt;AEG>   An investor group led by Coniston   Partners said it plans to continue its effort to gain control   of Allegis Corp despite the defensive maneuvers Allegis   announced last week.       Allegis said then that it would borrow three billion dlrs   and pay shareholders a dividend of 60 dlrs per share, lowering   the company's net worth. The Coniston group, which owns 13 pct   of Allegis stock, has said that it would seek shareholder   consents to remove 13 of the 16 Allegis directors. The group   had said it would consider breaking up Allegis into its   airline, hotel and vehicle rental components if it succeeded.       The Coniston group said it expects to make a further   announcement today on its plans for Allegis.       Wall Street analysts and traders had not expected Coniston   to abandon its pursuit of Allegis as a result of the Allegis   defensive measures.       Allegis officials were unavailable for comment.

"The vote was 1,229, or 54.5 pct, against, and 1,028, or   45.5 pct, for the contract. Eighty-one pct of the membership   voted," he said.       The union representative said that the pact offered cost of   living increases designed to keep pace with inflation, but   contained no wage increase.       The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and   prepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, he   said.       The three locals cover about 2,600 production and   maintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley,   B.C. lead-zinc mine.       Output at both sites has been shut down since the   production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office   and technical workers, went on strike May 9.       The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and   technical workers have not negotiated since May 21.       The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeure, which   means the company may not be able to honor contracts for   products from the smelter and mine.       Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of   which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.       The union had requested a three pct wage increase in each   year of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for a   three-year contract and some loosening of the rules on job   classifications.       The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,   produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of   lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles   east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,   most for processing at the Trail smelter.       The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.       Revenues from the Trail smelter totalled 356 mln Canadian   dlrs in 1986.

cocoa	DUTCH COCOA PROCESSORS UNHAPPY WITH ICCO BUFFER   Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with   the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa   Organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told   Reuters.       "The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost   nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be   actively depressing it," one company spokesman said.       Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total   amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he   recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.       Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the   1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which   the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.       "Even before he started operations, traders estimated the   manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes   maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level,   and yet he appears reluctant to do so," one manufacturer said.       "We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy   up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply   step back," he added.       "The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the   market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the   market because everyone is holding back from both buying and   selling waiting to see what the manager will do next," one   processor said.       "As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is   likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is   about to alter his methods," he added.       Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices   for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock   buying for some time to come.

acq	SPECTRA-PHYSICS &lt;SPY> BOARD REJECTS TENDER OFFER   Spectra-Physics Inc said its   board rejected a 32 dlrs per share unsolicited tender offer for   the company's stock from Ciba-Geigy Ltd &lt;CIGZ.Z>, which already   holds 18.8 pct of the stock.       Spectra-Physics said it also filed a lawsuit in Delaware   federal court this morning seeking to enjoin the offer and   alleging, among other things, that the offer vilates federal   securities laws, certain agreements between Ciba-Geigy and   Spectra-Physics, and Ciba-Geigy's fiduciary duties.       Spectra-Physics said the two Ciba-Geigy designess to its   board were not present at yesterday's special meeting which   voted to reject the offer as financially inadequate, unfair and   not in the best interests of Spectra-Physics or its   stockholders.       The company said the board also authorized a special   committee of outside directors to take whatever steps it deems   necessary to protect the interests of Spectra-Physics and its   stockholders and to investigate all alternatives to maximize   the value of the stock, including talks with third parties.       Spectra-Physics said a letter communicating the board's   recommendation and reasons therefore is being mailed to   stockholders.       It said Robert Bruce, Reliance Group Holdings Inc's &lt;REL>   designee on Spectra-Physics' board, resigned his position on   May 29. His letter of resignation said the action was to   alleviate Ciba-Geigy's stated justification for making the   unsolicited offer that it had not contemplated another   significant investor having representation on the board when   its Spectra-Physics' investment was made.
corn:grain:wheat	FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE   The U.S. Department of Agriculture's   forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will   almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be   surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.       The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'   Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal   Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or   end-of-season stocks.       However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end   1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln   was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.       The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast   in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for   soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and   the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.       This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around   31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of   Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares   against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.       ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign   will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC   official said.       Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to   estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and   to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.       He said, however, that among countries to which France   could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb   countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.       The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in   1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,   was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize   Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.       Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were   expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.       It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,   down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.
acq	BOEING &lt;BA> TO ACQUIRE DEFENSE ELECTRONICS FIRM   Boeing Co and ARGOSystems Inc &lt;ARGI.O>   said they reached an agreement for Boeing to acquire the   Sunnyvale, Calif., defense electronics firm for about 275 mln   dlrs.       The boards of both companies have approved the merger,   which will be accomplished through a tender offer by a Boeing   subsidiary of 37 dlrs a share cash for all of ARGOSystems'   shares, the companies said.       Under the agreement, the Boeing subsidiary, TBC Holdings   Corp, will begin the tender offer promptly. If at least 90 pct   of the shares are not tendered, the offer will be prorated to   49 pct, the companies said.       ARGOSystems has granted Boeing an option to buy 1,238,311   shares or 18.5 pct of the outstanding stock for 37 dlrs a   share, they said.       Also, Bill May, chairman of ARGOSystems, and three other   officers have granted Boeing an option to buy their shares,   another 8.9 pct of the outstanding stock, for 37 dlrs a share.       ARGOSystems makes equipment to monitor and analyze military   communications signals, electronic warfare equipment to monitor   and jam radar signals and signal processing systems.       For the nine months ended March 31, 1987, ARGOSystems   reported earnings more than doubled to 6.3 mln dlrs or 95 cts a   share from 3.1 mln dlrs or 46 cts. The year-ago period included   a 2.2 mln dlr charge from a writedown of securities. Sales rose   23.5 pct to 70.9 mln dlrs.       Sales are expected to exceed 100 mln dlrs for the fiscal   year ending June 30, the companies said in a joint statement.       The company's backlog is currently more than 180 mln dlrs,   they said. It has about 1,200 employees.       About 30 pct of ARGOSystems' business comes from   international customers.       "ARGOSystems is a clear leader in its field. This   association will expand our overall activities and   significantly enhance our ability to compete in the defense   electronics area," Boeing president Frank Shrontz said in a   statement.       ARGOSystems will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of   Boeing Co.       The merger following the tender offer will be subject to   approval by ARGOSystems shareholders, the companies said.       The tender offer and merger are subject to customary   conditions and expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino notification   waiting period, they said.

copper:corn:grain:sugar	ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT   The Zambian government today announced   minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new   economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the   northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.       However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,   were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could   provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more   sweeping reductions.       Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the   small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on   items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.       Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said   government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.       In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign   of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.       President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take   account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the   kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.       The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic   strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity   program.       Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of   unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile   region to take action against shops that did not reduce their   prices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in   the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the   government tried to lift maize subsidies.
trade	SEOUL ANNOUNCES MORE TARIFF CUTS FOR U.S.   South Korea will cut import taxes on 50   goods, including construction equipment, cigarettes and   tobacco, to help reduce its trade surplus with the United   States, the Finance Ministry said today. The tariff cuts of   between five and 30 pct will take effect on July 1.       South Korea ran a trade surplus of 7.3 billion dlrs with   Washington in 1986, sharply up from 4.3 billion in 1985.       Today's announcement brings to 157 the number of goods for   which similar measures were taken this year, a ministry   official said. The 157 are among about 290 items on which   Washington has asked Seoul to lower tariffs.       "This is in line with the government's policy to limit our   trade surplus with the United States to help reduce trade   friction between the two countries," said the official.

Entertaiment said it has requested an early meeting with   Crazy Eddie Inc's board and that it has committed 50 mln dlrs   toward the purchase of the shares including those already   purchased.

According to Entertainment, its company and its chairman   own about 4.3 pct of Crazy Eddie's currently outstanding   shares.       Additionally, the company said it is willing to negotiate   all aspects of its offer and is willing to consider a   transaction which would be tax free to Crazy Eddie's   shareholders.
crude:nat-gas	INDIA PLANS MORE BOMBAY OFFSHORE OIL WELLS   India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas   Commission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay   offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave   both oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said.       The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres,   yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas   per day, he said.       "The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80   km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil   and gas. We've decided to drill at least three more wells in   there before starting production on a commercial scale."       Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore   field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the   last two years.       ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending   March, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted   for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.   India's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.       ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed   since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay   High has reached a plateau.

crude	SAUDI RENEGOTIATION OF ARAMCO DEAL MOVING ALONG   Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its   collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the   latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a   fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry   sources said.       Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition,   said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34   mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and   volumes and other terms may be rearranged.       The agreement signed in January for the months from   February to June is up for renegotiation.       Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln   bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp   &lt;XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp   &lt;MOB> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> 550,000 bpd between them.       But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter   allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its   obligations under the contract       PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is   to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective   agrement.       John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research   Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of   a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate   schedule although separate agreements with the companies would   favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted   liftings occur .       "The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within   limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long   haul," he said.       Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely   concentrate on volume rather than price.       Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted   and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were   being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.       Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV>, Exxon   Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX> but is now   owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the   ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.
grain:wheat	OKLAHOMA CLEANING UP AFTER WEEK OF FLOODS, RAINS   Residents of central Oklahoma   returned to their homes over the weekend after a week of heavy   rains and severe flooding that left two dead and caused more   than 20 mln dlrs in damage, officials said.       Some 900 people were evacuated from their homes during the   rains and flooding last week, civil defense officials said.       Many of the shelters set up throughout the state in areas   threatened by flooding, except those near the Washita and Red   Rivers, closed as residents returned to their damaged homes.       Farmers who had expected a near-record wheat crop now say   this year will see one of the largest losses in decades.       Gov. Henry Bellmon, who on Thursday declared a flooding   emergency for central Oklahoma, was expected to ask President   Reagan for federal disaster relief for the area.       In northern Texas, officials reported several tornadoes on   Friday. A twister in Lubbock yesterday damaged six mobile homes   and two houses. No injuries were reported.

acq	PAY N' PAK &lt;PNP> GETS TWO OFFERS FOR COMPANY   Pay N' Pak Stores Inc said it received   two proposals in response to its previously announced   solicitation of potential buyers for the company.       The company said it is evaluating the proposals from Paul   Bilzerian and from a third party which is active in the   leveraged buyout field but which Pay N' Pak declined to   identify.       It said the Bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders to   receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs in   liquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemable   preferred stock for each common share.             Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is structured as a   merger in which each holder would receive a combination of   17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2   pct cumulative preferred.       The company said the dividend on the preferred offered by   Bilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financial   advisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred would   trade in the public market at its liquidation value.       Dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option of   the surviving corporation in cash or additional shares of   preferred for the first five years, it added..             Pay N' Pak said Bilzerian's proposal is subject to a   physical inventory of merchandise at June 30. Bilzerian did not   provide details with respect to financing of his proposal,   which is not subject to a financing condition.       The company said dividends on the preferred being offered   in the second proposal would be paid in additional preferred in   the first three years and the preferred would be redeemed in   years 12 and 13.       It said the second offer is contingent on the arrangement   of financing, adding the party making the offer is confident of   its ability to obtain the balance of the financing.

acq	MAXWELL FILES SUIT TO STOP HARCOURT &lt;HBJ>   Publisher Robert Maxwell's British   Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in   U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its   directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of   the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its   recapitalization.       The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp   &lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares   of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp   and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with   4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.       The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have   8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of   Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a   substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct   convertible debentures.       The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by   more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for   dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent   conveyance.       The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose   that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it   terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to   repay it.       Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to   stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an   extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed   at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.       British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,   or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the   recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its   alternatives.       British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation   with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt   failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on   Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.       British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous   increase effective on the June eight record date for the   dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon   conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged    Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert   denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not   have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after   the date.       British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs   worth of debentures.       The suit also alleges that management, the board of   directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of   entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston   Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,   the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible   voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase   program and the manner in which its financing has been   structured.

interest	U.K. BANKERS CONSIDER NEW ECGD FINANCING PLAN   Representatives of major U.K. Based banks   are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the   cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export   Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources   said.       The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD   and the Bank of England.       Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on   the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under   discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium   term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.          The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins   on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size   and maturity of the credit and the currency.       The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers   said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they   would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when   the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another   cost reduction plan.       At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the   ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing   government backed credit in the capital markets.          On credits that are refinanced an original lender would   receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln   stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.

The acquisition is being evaluated by Geodyne board members   not employed by the company, PaineWebber or any company   affiliated with PaineWebber. It will be subject to approval by   the board and series C preferred shareholders.       Geodyne Resources said a registration related to the stock   to be exchanged for Snyder has been filed with the SEC but has   not yet become effective.       The Snyder owners other than PainWebber are Geodyne's   president, Michael W. Tomasso, and its executive vice   president, James D. Snyder.       The company said the warrants will be offered solely to   investors in the PaineWebber/Geodyne Energy Income Program II.   For every 100 dlrs invested in the program, an investor will be   entitled to buy one warrant to purchase one Geodyne common   share at a price equal to 120 pct of the average closing price   of the stock for the 15 trading days prior to formation of the   partnership to which the investor subscribes.

The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government   will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the   field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil   taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.       Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had   today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision   had been taken and several questions remained unresolved.       It was unlikely the government would announce its decision   on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting   and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,   the sources added.       This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil   exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license   that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve   Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by   Conoco.       Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as   the most likely candidate for the first field development   project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central   Norway.

dfl:dmk:interest:money-fx	DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY   A cut of about half a percentage point   in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although   economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.       Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,   encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide   premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,   might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.       Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances   rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its   repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.       That rate has remained in force, just holding above the   five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial   bank borrowings.       Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German   repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,   forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.       In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to   three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money   market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans   rate on lending under its three month credit quota.       Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance   Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.       In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he   would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance   Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion   guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct   for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.       Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference   between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under   the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add   extra liquidity to the money market.       Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to   further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would   result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,   provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.       The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its   parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673   guilders per 100 marks.       Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10   guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level   that would not permit a change in the interest rate   differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers   said.       An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and   Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he   said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation   expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates   in the longer term.       In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,   or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts   point to a falling rate of economic growth.       "It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement   negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,"   the ABN economist said.       He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in   January, could also contribute to some inflation.       At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to   two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,   currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the   second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.       Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying   spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,   probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below   five pct.       Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in   the money market.

gold:silver	LITTLE REACTION TO COMEX PRICE LIMIT REMOVAL   The elimination of price limits on   precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in   New York appears to be having little effect on the market,   analysts said.       "There is nothing apparent from the change," said William   O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.   "The market has not approached the old price limits and trading   is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he added.       Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on   market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker   in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.       On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two   contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver   futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.       During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and   down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to   rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts   said.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much   confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.       The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms   a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades   in a timely manner.       Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the   nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.       O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX   metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts   could move any distance.       "This is amore realistic approach because the metals market   is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"   O'Neill said.       Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,   said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic   buying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.

lumber:trade	U.S. TRADE BILL VERY DANGEROUS FOR CANADA, LOBBY   A trade bill before the United States   House of Representatives "is a very dangerous bill for Canadian   industry," Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam   Zimmerman told reporters.       By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.   countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3   removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely   used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.       "Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant   rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be   vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language," he   said.       The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House   of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring   subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any   countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian   resource exports to the U.S.       Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and   U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he   said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries   vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax   imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber   to the U.S., Zimmerman added.       Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S.   forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail   duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.       "We represent the first victim of the move to price other   countries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,"   Zimmerman said.       "If we're an example, than other resource industries had   better watch out," he added.       Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plans   to discuss concerns about the U.S. trade bill with lobby groups   from other Canadian resource industries.

iron-steel	EC MINISTERS CONSIDER CUTBACKS IN STEEL SUPPORT   A new steel quota system that would   strictly limit European Community (EC) support to the industry   could be forced on producers if they fail to find their own   solution quickly, officials said.       EC industry ministers meeting here considered two key   proposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mln   tonnes by 1990.       The first would limit the current quota system, which has   protected EC output for seven years, only to flat products and   heavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel products   into free market competition.       The second proposal would link continuation of a quota   system with progress toward plant closures, although less than   a month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said they   had abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily.       The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solution   immediately, instead urging steel producers to try again to   reach agreement on voluntary cutbacks.       The EC Commission has said it will come up with detailed   proposals in July on the future of the EC steel industry and EC   industry ministers meet again in September to reach a final   decision.

lumber	CANADA LUMBER EXPORTS MAY BECOME UNPROFITABLE   Canada's softwood lumber will become   unprofitable for some forest product producers if prices   decline to about 175 U.S. dlrs per thousand board feet of two   by four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 U.S. dlrs,   Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told   reporters.       Zimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a move   by Canadian negotiators to impose last January a 15 pct export   tax on softwood lumber shipped to the U.S. in exchange for a   U.S. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervail   duty.       "I think that there has been a falling off in the market, so   I think there is a moderate slow down in the price now,"   Zimmerman said at a media briefing.       Zimmerman said the adverse impact from lower U.S. lumber   product prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern Canada   first, migrating westward.       "The country has swallowed a time bomb and it will go off   when times get tough," Zimmerman said.       He also said the federal government should maintain the   existing 15 pct export tax and not allow provinces to offset   the tax with increased provincial fees for cutting lumber.

acq	COMPUTER ASSOC. &lt;CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM   Computer Associates International Inc's   800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate its   strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition   from International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, Wall Street   analysts said.        "IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems   software," said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin   and Jenrette.       "But the combination of the two companies will clearly   present a much stronger front," he said.       Besides IBM, "Computer Associates will be far and away the   most powerful company in the field," added E.F. Hutton analyst   Terence Quinn.       That field is a segment of the market known as system   utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of   a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,   power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.       The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the   two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.   Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that   will find the competition much harder than in the past.       For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a   six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,   N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.       When the deal is completed sometime in August, the   company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past    Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent   software vendor.       Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang   took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought   15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3   mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.       Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer   businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe   computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.       Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the   merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.       On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six   companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.       For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on   sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.       The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely   because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,   Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the   dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or   56 cts a share.      At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different   businesses, only three of which were involved in computer   software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a   major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his   job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services   unit.       Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a   news conference that the merger would give computer users a   single source for a wide range of software products.       In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also   sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads   in the applications software market, where analysts said it has   been successful with accounting and banking systems.       Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and   enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the   company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said   about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.       Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of   current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But   they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute   Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.       Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of   completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,   he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05   dlrs a share.       Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations   of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing   and research and development.       Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.   Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50   dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly   33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.       Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most   software companies are currently valued at about 20 times   per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the   premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.          Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25   pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently   owns 58 pct of Uccel.       The executive said the merger would not alter his target of   maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.       In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the   deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice   Department.       Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the   merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.
acq	MAXWELL WOULD NOT RENEW BID IF SUIT FAILS   British press magnate Robert Maxwell said   his British Printing and Communication Corp Plc would not renew   its bid for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc &lt;HBJ> if the lawsuit   filed against Harcourt in New York today fails.

cocoa	COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION   Traders recently returned from West Africa   say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action   so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer   stock manager on buffer stock purchases.       One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the   Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the   International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.       So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been   taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,   only on an intermittent basis.       They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week   he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the   limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000   in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.       The traders recently returned from West Africa say   producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so   far, noting producing countries are part of the international   cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.       London traders say terminal market prices would have to   gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average   indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference   price).       However, little progress has been made in that direction,   and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower   intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.       The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be   making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the   agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.       Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager   are not confined to West African producers, they observed.       A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources   there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the   intermittent buffer stock buying activities.       In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than   21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total   potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.   Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa   Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.       Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from   Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271.       It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from   the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention   to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.

alum:copper:gold:silver	LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS   The elimination of limits on daily price   fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the   Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect   on the market, analysts said.       "There is nothing apparent from the change," said William   O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.       "The market has not approached the old price limits and   trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he said.       On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two   contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper   and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,   which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver   futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting   of all daily limits, effective today.       Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per   ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the   nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.       Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back   months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby   contracts amid quiet trading today.       During the last week of April, silver futures often traded   at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the   dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or   unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.       As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many   unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.       The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs   for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.       Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,   said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic   buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.       O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would   add caution to trading.       "This is a more realistic approach because the metals   market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"   O'Neill said.

tin	TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET   European free market tin traders made a   somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur   dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.       Traders said the new market would probably be a useful   trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin   interests although European traders generally appear to be   reasonably satisfied with the current "free market" system   which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin   trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to   see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and   what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.       There is also a view among European traders that, while the   proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another   useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian   government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by   the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.       Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of   trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while   there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject   a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court   litigation actions have been resolved.       Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently   around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse   Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten   year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as   4,680 stg in December 1986.       This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading   ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350   stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.       LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065   tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485   tonnes reached in February 1986.       Traders said the free market turned bullish during late   last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand   deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting   prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.       However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing   in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to   4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.       The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very   little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.       There was also a lack of significant demand from major   steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.       Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin   holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,   and the bulk of material still available is being held by   Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the   market with unwanted metal.       Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the   International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted   support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members   nations of the International Tin Agreement.       The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker   Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported   having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin   position.       Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin   prices and movements are still expected to be largely related   to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand   emerges for the third quarter.       The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made   efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world   prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an   export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two   major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and   apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to   consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.

crude:ship	REAGAN HINTS U.S. WANTS HELP IN PATROLLING GULF   President Reagan said he would discuss   the Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's   Venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in   preserving free navigation.       In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made   plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack,   Reagan said the American people were aware that "it is not our   interests alone that are being protected."       Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret,   Reagan declared, "During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will   be discussing the common security interests shared by the   western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf.       "The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower   before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand   alone."       Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West   Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which   will take place in Venice June 8-10.             The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial   democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising   congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf   shipping and demands that the allies do more.        These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile   attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen.       "They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring   aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its   vital interests," Reagan said.             In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of   the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign   affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by   West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system.       "While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed   enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world   economy is the business of every member of the world trading   community," he said.             "It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan   and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented   domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading   system on which they depend."       Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with   allied accords on exchange rate stability.       "Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at   this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in   Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten," he   said. "The commitments made at these meetings need to be   translated into action."

acq	BILZERIAN PREPARED TO TENDER FOR PAY N'PAK &lt;PNP>   Investor Paul Bilzerian said if Pay N'   Pak Stores Inc enters into a merger accord with him he will   immediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrs   per share in cash.       Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to   a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the   company this morning.       The company said it is evaluating both proposals.   Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at   a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay   N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.           Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and "we   may add a bank to that."       "We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign," he   said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be   exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.       Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,   which the company did not identify, topped his offer between   now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an   opportunity to respond.       Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did   say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement   regarding management's equity participation.       Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management   particpation was "nominal."       Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was   disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.       "We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22   dlrs," said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for   17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct   cumulative preferred stock.          Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said "you   have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid."       Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the   company has not made the best strategic moves over the years.   "They have not done the right things at the right time," he   said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined   since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the   fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings,   he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln   dlrs.       Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people   than many competitors, but it competes on price even though   competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins.   He noted that there have been no other publicly identified   bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier   Bilzerian proposal in mid-April.       Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for   another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone   in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a   deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and   Bilzerian's plan.

crude	MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS   Flooding in the Red River on the   Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a   24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per   day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a   Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.       "The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any   divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility   that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week," a company   source said.       The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and   one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.       Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is   restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring   oil which has been lost to the flood.       "But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be   difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like   to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to."       The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield   Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell   Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's   operator.        Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude   oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to   new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.       July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to   19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.       Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of   WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.       Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline   shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West   Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a   barrel below WTI, respectively.       Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at   Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days   but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River   recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is   dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area   affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.       He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was   underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.   The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil   nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was   apparently washed away.             The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed   at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this   line.       Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not   found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,   which is nearby.

crude	CONGRESSMAN SAYS U.S. UNPREPARED FOR OIL CUTOFF   Rep. Mike Synar said today that while   President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect   Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared   at home to deal with a new energy crisis.       Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments   on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.   participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing   program of the International Energy Agency.       The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was   formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal   with any future oil cutoff.       Synar said, "the president is prepared to take military   action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to   take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our   nation for the next energy crisis."       Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers   to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,   increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar,   who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in   a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully   advocated a test limited to training participants in oil   sharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.

lead:strategic-metal:zinc	COMINCO &lt;CLT.TO> SEES MEETING WITH STRIKING UNION LOCALS   Cominco Ltd said it   expects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers of   America locals on strike at its Trail smelter and Kimberley,   B.C. lead-zinc mine, a Cominco spokesman said.       It had no meeting scheduled with the other three striking   locals, which rejected a tentative three-year contract   Saturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.       Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost of   living increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, but   no wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5   pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.       The three locals represent about 2,600 production and   maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about   600 office and technical workers.       The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.   Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the   strike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare force   majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor   contracts for products from the smelter and mine.       Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of   which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.       The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,   produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of   lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles   east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,   most for processing at the Trail smelter.       The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.       Trail smelter revenue was 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986.

lead:strategic-metal:zinc	COMINCO SEEKS MEETING WITH STRIKING UNION LOCALS   Cominco Ltd said it   expects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers of   America locals on strike at its Trail smelter and Kimberley,   B.C. lead-zinc mine, a Cominco spokesman said.       It had no meeting scheduled with the other three striking   locals, which rejected a tentative three-year contract   Saturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.       Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost of   living increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, but   no wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5   pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.       The three locals represent about 2,600 production and   maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about   600 office and technical workers.       The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.   Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the   strike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare force   majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor   contracts for products from the smelter and mine.       Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of   which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.       The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,   produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of   lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles   east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,   most for processing at the Trail smelter.       The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.       Trail smelter revenue was 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986.

acq	USPCI &lt;UPC> SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID   share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP),    analysts said.       "The offer is inadequate," said Douglas Augenthaler, an   analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the   needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on   earnings estimates.       USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at   48-1/8, down 3/8.       USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could   not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board   would meet to consider it.       Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34   dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement   that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its   value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed   analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.       At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the   low 40s, Augenthaler said.       Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste   management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the   announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90   dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.       In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management   business holds significant growth potential. The industry has   grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on   earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder   Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at   15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.       Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs   total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation   and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable   business and win cost-control benefits, he said.       "Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly   signficant environmmental problems of its own," he said.       Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds   a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer   was "grossly inadequate."
crude	TOTAL PETROLEUM &lt;TPN> SHUTS TEXAS PIPELINES   Total Petroleum NA &lt;TPN> shut down   several small crude oil pipelines operating near the   Texas/Oklahoma border last Friday as a precaution against   damage from local flooding, according to Gary Zollinger,   manager of operations.       Total shut a 12-inch line that runs across the Ouachita   River from Wynnewood to Ardmore with a capacity of 62,000 bpd   as well as several smaller pipelines a few inches wide with   capacities of several thousand bpd or less, Zollinger said.       The Basin Pipeline, a major pipeline running 300,000 bpd,   run by a consortium of other oil companies, was closed today.       One other small pipeline that Total also closed has a   capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 bpd and crosses the Red River in   Fargo, Texas, Zollinger said.       He said the closed pipelines run under river water and   could be damaged as the flooded rivers erode the river banks   and expose the piping.       Zollinger said Total is waiting for the river waters to   recede before they reactivate the pipelines.

William Rogers,   Omni Drilling Partnership No 1978-2 and Entex Inc.       DOE alleged Trigon caused overcharges of 624,208 dlrs by   improperly classifying its oil as "newly discovered crude," a   classification that allowed charging higher prices during a   period of price controls.       It said the proposed settlements would resolve disputes   over possible violations by the five parties. DOE added that in   agreeing to the settlements, the five did not admit any   violations or non-compliance with its regulations.       It said it would receive written comments on the   settlements before making it final.

hog	NPPC APPEAL ON CANADIAN PORK DISMISSED   The U.S. Court of International Trade has   upheld the International Trade Commission's refusal to extend   countervailing duties on Canadian hogs to include pork   products, the National Pork Producers' Council said.       The court's ruling came in an appeal to the Trade   Commission's decision filed by the Pork Producers' Council.       Council president Tom Miller said he was disappointed by   the court ruling and said the council will accelerate   activities in support of an amendment to the 1930 Tariff Act   that would address the objections outlined in the Trade   Commission's ruling.       The Commission had said there was insufficient economic   integration between the pork production industry and the pork   packing industry to justify extending the duty on live hogs to   fresh, chilled or frozen pork.       The legislation has already passed the House of   Representatives and recently passed the Senate Finance   Committee. It is expected to be considered by the full Senate   by the end of the summer.       An appeal by the Canadian Pork Council that the current   countervailing duty on Canadian hogs entering the U.S. be   lifted is pending before the Court.

acq	EDELMAN GROUP CUTS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> STAKE   New York investor Asher Edelman and   Dominion Textile Inc &lt;DTX.T>, who are currently seeking to   acquire Burlington Industries Inc in a hostile tender offer,   said they lowered their stake in the company.       In a filing with the Secruties and Exchange Commission, the   Edelman/Dominion group, known as Samjens Acqusition Corp, said   it sold options to buy 258,800 Burlington common shares,   reducing its stake in the company to 3,408,813 shares, or 12.33   pct, from 3,667,313 shares, or 13.3 pct.       The group said the sale, which represented all the   Burlington options it owned, was made May 28 for 8.7 mln dlrs.       The Edelman/Dominion group last week sweetened its hostile   tender offer to 77 dlrs a share, after Burlington agreed to a   leveraged buyout by a Morgan Stanley and Co-backed group for 76   dlrs a share.       But the Edelman/Dominion group, which has litigation   pending against Burlington, also said it has held talks with   Morgan Stanley about "the possibility of settlement of   outstanding matters among" it, Morgan Stanley and Burlington.
acq	ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING TOPS CRAZY EDDIE OFFER   A quickly growing Texas-based   distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs   for Crazy Eddie Inc &lt;crzy>, the leading New York City   electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its   founder has bid.       The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em>   for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie   Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada   announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.       Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and   profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the   highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer   electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of   electronics retailers have sagged.       The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment   Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose   present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had   the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to   drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.       "I have mixed feelings," said analyst Dennis Telzrow of   Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. "On the one hand   it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does   Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it   and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"       "It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing," said   analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a   Minneapolis brokerage. "Electronics retailing is very management   concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in   place."       Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already   owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may   be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its   7-dlr-a-share offer.       Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high   4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was   announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share   in over-the- counter trading.        Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York   City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that   his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.       A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken   no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs   since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He   would not comment on the new offer.       Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as   disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to   retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to   consumers by cable television.       In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to   87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit   went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.       Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,   Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in   a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase   of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to   assist in financing the balance.       Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to   borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since   Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same   amount.       Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday   to 9.50.

acq	INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC   The investor group that has agreed to   buy &lt;Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal   computer retailer public or sell it to other investors,   industry analysts said.       "Now's a good time," said Joe Levy of International Data   Corp. "The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is   on the way up again," he said.       Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC   retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by   an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.       Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,   William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and   venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the   transaction.       Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores   generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150   mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay   royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.       Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to   Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be   reached for comment.       E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture   capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel   Inc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money   manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.      Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong   upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key   changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like   Businessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shack   stores. "The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,   customer service and customer support," said Levy of   International Data.          Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners   have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up   managment control of the company in 1985.       Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive   officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell   much of the franchisee dissent.

acq	BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW   U.S. District Court Judge Eugene   A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on   Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop   Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.       Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could   be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover   battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.       Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers   for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion   Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.       Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary   injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until   the case is decided.       Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr   buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share   lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens   last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens   offer.       Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and   Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about   the company in making their takeover attempt.           That information, Burlington said, was provided by James   Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber   Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23   years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's   sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,   1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to   divulge inside information about the company.       Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began   working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to   "takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its   management," Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.       Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from   PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information   and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or   Burlington's public financial statements.       Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with   Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with   them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went   public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.   Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a   takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in   February.       Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held   discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as   financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off   because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and   dominion with a written statement that they did not provide   inside information.       Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen   withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman   Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and   threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an   effort to takeover Burlilgnton.       "The ultimate question is not the price per share or the   profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for   those who would takeover an American company," said burlington   lawyer Humphrey.       Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the   largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in   violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's   largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants   in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,   the lawyers said.       Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the   market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends   and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light   weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price   dictate.       Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by   Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid   for Dominion. "Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose   would have been sauce for the gander," said Sidney Rosdeitcher,   a Samjens lawyer.
acq	EDELMAN DETAILS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> OPTIONS SALE   A tender offer of Asher Edelman and   Dominion Textile Ltd &lt;DTX.TO> for Burlington Idustries Inc is   not affected by the investors' sale of options to buy   Burlington stock, according to an associate of Edelman.       Noting that "our tender offer is definitely in place" the   aide said the investors are prohibited by Securities and   Exchange Commission regulations from exercising options as long   as a tender offer is open. The options are due to expire at the   end of June.       He said the May 28 sale of options to buy 258,800   Burlington shares was thus a "non-event."

alum	VENEZUELA GETS 300 MLN DLRS CREDIT FOR ALUMINUM   Venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln   dlrs in financing for industrial projects and increased its   lines of credit for import financing, finance minister Manuel   Azpurua said.       'We can say that we are achieving the recuperation of   credit, but that cannot be done overnight,' Azpurua said in a   television interview.       He said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be signed   this week with the German state bank Kreditanstalt fur   Wiederaufbau (KFW), to finance an expansion of the state   aluminum company Venalum.       The credit will be divided into two separate agreements,   one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and   another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct.       Azpurua said financing has also been obtained for expansion   of Alcasa, another state aluminum company, and for projects in   the state steel and petrochemical industries.       Yesterday, he said Venezuela obtained two new credits of   5.0 mln dlrs each for export financing, one from Credit du Nord   of France and the other from Britain's Midland Bank.       The Venezuelan government has been criticised at home for   failing to obtain new credits, despite its insistence on   repaying foreign debt according to the terms of a rescheduling   accord reached last February.       Azpurua recently visited Tokyo hoping to acquire new   credits for industrial expansions but clinched no agreements.   Japanese officials refused to allow a new issue of Venezuelan   bonds until the country regains its 'Triple A' credit rating.
dlr:money-fx:trade	U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND   The dollar's recent signs of stability   have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,   but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until   after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.       "The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the   dollar has bottomed out," said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.       Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value   against the yen and the mark as part of an officially   orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on   world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.       On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen   but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,   topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.       Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far   enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.       The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March   from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued   improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.       Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if   further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up   towards 150 yen.       "There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed   out for the medium term," added Tom Campbell of First National   Bank of Chicago.       Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing   expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would   be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's   larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and    more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.       The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen   speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central   bank intervention to support the dollar.       The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that   the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion   dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount   since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.       Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention   volume as "impressive".       James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,   however: "the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade   data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and   140 yen."       Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York   warned, "I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."       Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada   said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of   the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.       Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction   to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,   which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous   commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.       President Reagan said today, "economic policy decisions   made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of   Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be   ignored or forgotten."       "The commitments made at these meetings need to be   translated into action," he added in a speech, celebrating the   40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.       Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,   analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the   brunt of U.S. calls for further action.       Marine Midland's O'Neill said, "pressure will build up on   Germany to take stimulative action like Japan."       Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar   could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come   under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is   not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade   surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust   banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar   positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign   portfolios, while some others have started covering those short   positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

acq	HARCOURT &lt;HBJ> DEBENTURES MAY TRIGGER SUIT   Holders of convertible subordinated   debentures of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc threatened to sue   the company if they do not get more information about how their   investment will be affected by the company's proposed   recapitalization plan.       The holders, none of whom was willing to be identified,   said although Harcourt has urged that they convert their shares   to common stock by the June eight record date for a special   dividend, they were unable to determine if it might be better   for them to continue holding the debentures.             "There are rumors that various houses will bring litigation   if we don't get answers," said a Wall Street source. Officials   of Harcourt declined to comment, citing a suit brought by   British publisher Robert Maxwell whose has been trying to   acquire Harcourt.       Executives of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial   adviser, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.       When it announced its recapitalization May 26 Harcourt   advised holders of the 6-3/8 pct convertible subordinated   debentures due 2011 to convert into common by the June eight   record date for the company's special dividend.       Harcourt's special dividend pays 40 dlrs per share in cash   plus a security worth 10 dlrs. Holders would also retain stock   in the recapitalized firm.       The debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share.   Harcourt's May 26 announcement said the conversion price would   be adjusted according to the indenture covering the securities.   Arbitrageurs said the conversion formula yielded a "negative   number" and thus they needed further information from the   company.
alum	VENEZUELA OBTAINED 300 MILLION DLRS IN CREDITS   venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln   dlrs in financing for industrial projects and has also   increased its lines of credit for import financing, finance   minister manuel azpurua said.       "we can say that we are achieving the recuperation of   credit, but that cannot be done overnight," azpurua said in a   television interview.       Azpurua said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be   signed this week with the german state bank kreditanstalt fur   wiederaufbau (kfw), to finance an expansion of the state   aluminum company venalum.       The credit will be divided into two separate agreements,   one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and   another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct. Azpurua said financing   had also been obtained for the expansion of alcasa, another   state aluminum company, as well as for projects in the state   steel and petrochemical industries. He did not provide details.       Yesterday, after a meeting of leaders of the ruling accion   democratica party, azpurua said venezuela had obtained two new   credits of five mln dlrs each for export financing, one from   credit du nord of france and the other from the midland bank of   great britain.       The finance minister's statements came as the government is   under sharp criticism for failing to obtain new credits,   despite its insistence on repaying the foreign debt according   to the terms of a rescheduling accord reached last february.       Azpurua and other senior economic officals returned from a   trip to tokyo last week in which they hoped to acquire new   credits for industrial expansions, but no agreements were   reached.       Japanese officials also refused to allow a new issue of   venezuelan debt bonds because until the country regains its   'triple a' credit classification.
crude	SOUTH KOREA INCREASES DUTY ON CRUDE IMPORTS   South Korea has increased its duty on crude   oil imports to 4.29 dlrs a barrel from 3.29 dlrs, effective   today, the energy ministry said.       The duty, to raise funds for special energy projects, was   adjusted after average crude import prices rose to 16.85 dlrs a   barrel in April, from 16.65 dlrs in March and 13.08 dlrs in   April 1986, ministry officials said.       A separate 24.5 pct import tax on crude oil is unchanged.
acq	EQUITICORP TASMAN TO BID FOR MONIER LTD   &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL) said it will   offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of   Monier Ltd &lt;MNRA.S>, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a   share bid by CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S>.       Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents   cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.       As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for   Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by   Friday.       It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign   Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as   foreign because of its New Zealand base.       The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28   mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.       Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the   alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the   value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the   diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.       ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance   conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment   and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.       ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the   shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.       ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd> associate have   targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion   and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.       Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement   that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend   acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.       He also said Monier will not now proceed with the   one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on   March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.       As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex   put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder,   Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice of   accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to   50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.       CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland   taking the second option, resulting in the two companies   running Monier as a joint venture.       CSR officials have also said they had no intention of   raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention   became public last week.
money-fx	VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS   Venezuela's central bank has ordered   Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange   operations with brokers based outside the country, according to   a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.       The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has   effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's   volatile currency market.       The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez   Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international   operations.       The telex said the restriction on business with foreign   brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign   exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign   currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.       In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied   rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to   prop up the weakening bolivar.       But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de   facto currency control. "It is definitely a control in the sense   that there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one broker   here said.       "Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction   is towards complete control," the broker said.       The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his   Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since   the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with   telephone calls.       He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume   of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs   a day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," he   said.       The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the   prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary   between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.       "We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's   ridiculous," he said. "They've been on a rampage against   foreigners."       The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central   bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange   business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct   reserve requirement.       In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in   bolivar futures, the broker said.       "We used to have a forward market," he said. "For a small   currency it was miraculous."       He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.   Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range   of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running   out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free   market.

interest	Tokyo - Bundesbank's Schlesinger sees no reason to lower interest rates    Tokyo - Bundesbank's Schlesinger sees no reason to lower interest rates
gnp:interest	NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER   Bundesbank vice president Helmut   Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.       With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in   May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,   Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a   further cut in interest rates was needed.       The economy is picking up, after contracting by a   seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from   the fourth, he added. "We may have an increase in gnp starting   in the second quarter," he said in an interview.       Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been   pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its   imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.       Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was   mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in   1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.       He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole   would probably be between one and two pct.      "It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic   demand does not grow strongly," he said, noting that interest   rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.       Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money   stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace   of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six   pct target.       He said the target could still be achieved but much will   depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy   inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS   revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.       "There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of   foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit   reversed," Schlesinger said.       A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction   that the mark was headed higher. "As we can see from the market,   expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have   diminished," Schlesinger said.       The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the   fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period   and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined   towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.       Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar   rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87   marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.       At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.       "Central banks are always in contact about these   fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,"   Schelsinger said.       "One has to look at how it (the market) is moving," he said,   adding, "It is not only our own case, it is also the American   case."       He said that the West German export industry has been hit   hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see   some correction now. "But it wouldn't be good to have short-term   fluctuations," he said. "Let us wait and see."       "It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very   short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level   (of rates) as such," Schlesinger said.       The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of   such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West   German inflation down year.       Although there have recently been signs of inflation   picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key   commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would   be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.       Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth   was longer term, in that the economy was building up the   potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.       The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16   months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of   targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the   mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.       But he added: "I don't see any great pressure to go away   from it."
acq:crude	JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS   Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could   mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into   bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.       They said the relaxation of controls was now under review   by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of   International Trade and Industry (MITI).       A spokesman for a major firm said, "Deregulation would bring   about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer   competition, we have no choice but to accept it."       The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.       The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it   should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It   should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of   current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and   gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.       They said deregulation was vital to promote more   competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.       "Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn   to see if we can survive cut-throat competition," said a source   at one major Japanese oil company.       A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, "We'll have a hard   time surviving, but that's something we must go through."       "In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for   the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out   further into other lines such as real estate and travel   agencies," he said.       Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd   which had the largest share of refined products sales in the   Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining   capacity in fiscal 1986.       Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products   in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a   spokesman for the company said.       Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the   Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies   within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the   efficiency of the industry.       Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to   be streamlined further into five refining groups.       "MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to   merge into five to build up their muscles," a source said.       A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the   possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry   in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.       He declined to officially confirm or deny that the   Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but   said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards   deregulation.

crude:ship	JAPAN READY TO USE DIPLOMACY FOR GULF SECURITY   Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help   maintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro   Nakasone said.       But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of   communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take   a broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministry   said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and   Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980.       Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial   help to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan's   crude oil passes through the waterway.       President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in   the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda   for next week's G-7 summit in Venice.       Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up   its naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional   expressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to help   maintain freedom of navigation.       Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from being   deployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washington   understands this problem.

MEES said the price adjustments, arrived at through   negotiations between the Omani oil ministry and companies   concerned, are designed to compensate for the difference   between market-related prices and the official price of 17.63   dlrs per barrel adopted by non-OPEC Oman since February.

"As packers and remillers expect   production to recover to normal levels in June, sellers will   remain reserved in the near future," the review, dated May 14,   said.

The market is mindful of approaching summer holidays in   industrial countries and there is an air of uncertainty beyond   July, it said. It gave no figures for the output drop.
gnp	CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET   The Philippines' first quarter growth   figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely   to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose   Fernandez said in an interview.       The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)   announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct   and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter   from a year earlier.       "I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it   (growth) short," Fernandez said.        NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the   fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP   growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.       "Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources   and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that   domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and   would not be a stumbling block," Fernandez said.       "I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at   key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,   showed that the economy was on a different track from last   year," he said.       Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the   first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it   could drop off in the third quarter.       He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the   manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in   1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.       "That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular," he said.       He said the government had met all monetary targets set for   the first quarter in consultation with the International   Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth   tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.       The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling   58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.   Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or   August to review performance in the January-June period.       He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion   dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.   Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their   net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.       "It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA   (official development assistance) accounts the commercial   banking system will be requested to hold the line," he said.       It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF   debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.       The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28   billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.       Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984   to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in   April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in   October last year, had almost been completed.       He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level   touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.   "Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool," he said.       Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, "I   think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own   receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap   forward as might have been suitable."       The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach   29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.       NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first   quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.       Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of   between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while   growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.       Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some   economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the   dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more   competitive.       "By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso   has already substantially devalued against all of the country's   trading partners," he said.       On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was   opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted   repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two   years after the imposition of the Code.       The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has   been delayed by objections from some business groups.       "I think any central bank, certainly this one after the   events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be   prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds   and I'm not about to do that," Fernandez said.       "It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of   capital and earnings can be free," he said.       "We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly   we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external   availabilities simply by servicing our debts."
ipi	BELGIAN FEBRUARY INDUSTRY OUTPUT DOWN ON YEAR AGO   Belgian industrial production, excluding   construction and adjusted for seasonal and calendar influences,   was provisionally 0.6 pct lower in February than a year   earlier, the National Statistics Office said.       Output in February was, however, 5.9 pct higher than in   January.       A spokeswoman for the office said the production index,   base 1980, rose to a provisional 108.8 in February from a   provisional 102.7 in January, slightly revised from the 102.8   originally estimated. In February last year the index stood at   109.5.

gnp	GERMAN GNP FIGURES PUBLICATION DELAYED   Figures for first quarter 1987 West   German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were   provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal   Statistics Office said.       The official said there had been a delay in gathering   information for the data, which are expected to show that the   West German economy contracted in the period.       A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there   was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on   June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.       "There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical   matter," he added.       The West German government is expected to come under   pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners   to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international   trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.       However, government officials have ruled out any further   tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of   stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.       Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German   central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the   widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real   terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first   quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.        The government has confirmed that growth was negative in   the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to   be about two pct.       Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to   cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,   at three pct, is just above historical lows.       West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice   summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,   is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered   from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over   two years.       The government has pointed out that depressed exports are   the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but   says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will   compensate for this setback.       It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under   two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.
acq	STAD ROTTERDAM TAKES STAKE IN SWISS-OWNED INSURER   Dutch insurer Stad Rotterdam Anno 1720   N.V. &lt;ASRN.AS> said from July 1 it will own 20 pct of the   shares of &lt;Europeesche Verzekering Maatschappij N.V.>, a   fully-owned unit of Swiss insurer &lt;Union   Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft>.       Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told Reuters it   may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies   are found to be sufficiently compatible.       Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche   made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at   below the shares' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum.       The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation   insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986.       Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion   guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer.       Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which   narrowed to 4.5 mln guilders in 1986, van Leeuwen said.       He said the company was on course for independent recovery   and was expected to reduce its losses further in 1987.
acq	DUFFOUR IGON GIVES BACKING TO AGA TAKEOVER BID   French industrial gas group &lt;Duffour et   Igon> has decided to back the takeover bid by Swedish   industrial gases group Aga AB &lt;AGA.ST>, ending a lengthy battle   between rival bidders from France, Spain and West Germany,   Duffour et Igon Chairman Jean Igon said.       The board agreed late last night to back the Aga bid and   advise its shareholders to accept the Swedish group's latest   offer of 4,410 francs per share, he told Reuters.       The other main bidders were Union Carbide Corp's &lt;UK.>   French subsidiary &lt;Union Carbide France> and West Germany's   Linde AG &lt;LING.F>.       Aga topped rival bids for the gases distribution group in   May by raising its offer to 4,410 francs from 4,000 francs.       This was accepted by Spain's &lt;Carburos Metalicos SA> which   sold Aga six pct of Duffour et Igon's stock and the right of   first refusal on the remaining nine pct of stock it holds. It   also won over the French Midi-Pyrenees development authority   which agreed to sell Aga its 20 pct stake in Duffour et Igon.       Under Aga's offer, shareholders can either accept a cash   bid or exchange one share in Duffour et Igon for one bond of a   nominal value of 4,410 francs with a 10 pct coupon issue by Aga   France SA. The bond issue is guaranteed by the parent Aga AB.       The takeover battle for the Toulouse-based company, which   controls eight pct of the French industrial gas distribution   market, began on April 2 with an offer of 2,100 francs per   share from Union Carbide France &lt;UK>.       Aga's offer, which puts a price of 587 mln francs on the   company, closes on June 24 and the results will be announced on   July 21.       Duffour et Igon shares were quoted yesterday at 4,410   francs, with no buyers, after a series of suspensions during   the takeover tussle. They traded at 856 francs on January 9   before the first suspension.

Total Exploration had interests ranging from 18.75 to 25   pct in four blocks in permit ATP259P in south-west Queensland,   Santos said in a statement.       The Santos group stakes will rise to between 52.5 and 70   pct of the four ATP259P blocks as a result of the purchase. The   price was not disclosed.       Santos said a number of oil and gas fields have been   discovered in the Total Exploration areas and that it regards   them as having very good prospects for further discoveries.       Total's reserves amount to 75 billion cubic feet of gas and   5.5 mln barrels of oil and condensate, it said.       It said it will promote a vigorous exploration program in   the areas for the rest of 1987 and in the future.       The acquisition is the latest in a series by Santos as part   of a program to expand from its origins in the South Australian   Cooper Basin.
money-fx	POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK   For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is   the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has   played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for   the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the   mark.       President of the powerful and independent West German   central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his   contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the   end of this year, government officials say.       (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)       But no official announcement has yet been made, raising   eyebrows in West Germany's business community.       The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top   ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in   opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.       There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl   would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own   Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked   closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard   Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.       Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul   Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international   reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.       Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook   Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor   Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was   Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as   Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.       In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the   dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of   the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution   which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent   inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts   of galloping inflation this century.       But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and   inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe   to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the   dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.       "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the   dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the   Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark   would endanger the economy in West Germany," he told business   journalists in Frankfurt recently.       Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that   Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.       "Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not   focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external   economy," she said.       An economist at a German bank, who declined to be   identified, said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will   certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so   rigidly oriented towards money supply."       One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to   persuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. For   Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that   the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise   currencies.       The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency   dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in   fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.       "This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they   don't know - what the central banks can do," Poehl says of   intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates   round, making a speculator's position worthless.       Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist   in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.       A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over   a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.       He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and   play golf.       Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute   for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.       "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount   if you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealers   are very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers of   many people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,   the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

sugar	CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS   China will not increase sugar imports   substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints   and large stocks, despite falling production and rising   domestic demand, traders and the official press said.       "Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the   last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to   be extremely serious," the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986   plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because   farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical   and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.       The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop   (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year   earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.       The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500   tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier   figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China   News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.       The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province   fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the   area under sugar was dropping.       "Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate," the newspaper   said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of   nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane   is a major problem."       A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,   south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in   area planted.       He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel   developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the   maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.       The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province   of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667   hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only   70 from one mu of sugarbeet.       The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to   4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.       Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed   with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in   falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.       The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the   official press has said.       Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of   sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.       The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln   tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.       A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks   in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import   sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986   when the central government resumed control of imports.       "As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored   in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas," the diplomat   said.       The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to   consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly   as coal had priority. "How quickly they can move the sugar is   one factor determining import levels," he said.       Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,   China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.       "China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about   152/153 dlrs a tonne," he added. "China is not a desperate buyer   now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into   the open market."       A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding   imports was price.       "While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,   foreign exchange restraints persist," he said.       The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five   pct a year but "a communist government is in a much better   position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the   foreign exchange situation demands it."

The central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to   the decline in the value of exports and re-exports to 37.2   billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985. This reflected the   decline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing   UAE oil, the central bank added.       The surplus on the current account narrowed to 6.8 billion   dirhams from 25.5 billion in 1985. The overall balance showed a   surplus of 4.8 billion after 2.6 billion in 1985.
ship	KUWAIT REJECTS IRANIAN SPY BOAT CHARGES   Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the   emirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected   charges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy   boats.       "There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian   accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels   recently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out   fishing," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.       It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was   summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign   Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.       The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized   seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who   confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.       It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah   waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the   head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.       The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf   Arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in   the waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was   scheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime   Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and   oil ministers.       Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait   News Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing   vessels by Iran was not the first.       Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait   had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.       "However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian   charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were   undertaking espionage activities," it said.       Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked   Tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the   statement said.

propane	BP CUTS NORTH SEA PROPANE PRICE, BUTANE UNCHANGED   British Petroleum LP Gas International   said it cut its North Sea LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas) posted   price for propane to 95 dlrs from 110 dlrs a tonne, effective   June 1.       The move follows a similar cut to 92 from 108 dlrs a tonne   announced by Shell U.K. Ltd Friday, also fob North Sea   terminals and effective June 1 until further notice. Both   companies left their butane prices unchanged at 123 dlrs a   tonne.       A BP statement said its cut came "as a result of a price   review occasioned by substantial changes in the LPG market." BP   last lowered its posted propane price from 175 dlrs a tonne on   March 1, and Shell U.K.'s last change was from 113 dlrs May 1.
crude	SAUDI ARABIA WILL NOT AGREE "MAD" OIL PRICE RISE   Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazer   said Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would   not accept a "mad" increase that would drive consumers away.       He told al-Riyadh newspaper, "Saudi Arabia follows a   balanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in   prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad   increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and   find alternative sources (for energy)."       OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world   prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system   aimed to stabilise the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.       OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it   will review its current oil price and production policy.       Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil   prices to remain stable for the next two years.       Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and   production pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The   current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of   15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs   a barrel average.

They   added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge   of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend   foreign exchange to importers and exporters.       Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks   reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,   according to official statistics.       Last week the central bank said that from today it would   reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40   pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move   was needed because of "distortions" in the foreign exchange   market.       Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,   have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank   market to avoid exchange rate losses.       Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May   reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9   billion in April.       All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted   into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming   exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in   the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.       In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on   remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to   Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.       Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of   the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of   speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has   flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..       Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about   22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.       Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the   foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on   capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will   be dropped by the end of July or early August.       Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused   jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy   purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold   about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.       Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to   close at 1,803.08.
reserves	U.K. RESERVES RISE UNDERLYING 4.8 BILLION DLRS IN MAY, (2.9 BILLION APRIL) - OFFICIAL    U.K. RESERVES RISE UNDERLYING 4.8 BILLION DLRS IN MAY, (2.9 BILLION APRIL) - OFFICIAL
reserves	U.K. RESERVES SHOW RECORD UNDERLYING RISE IN MAY   Britain's gold and currency reserves rose   a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's   2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said.       The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of   England intervention on currency markets to curb sterling's   strength. It was above market expectations which had been for a   rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.       The Treasury declined comment on the figures.       Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared   with April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68   billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April.       Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln   dlrs, against April's 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were   85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments   of eight mln, after three mln last month.       Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.       The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and   repayments.       It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs   rise seen in October 1977. The May increase represents the   seventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs in   that period, and up 9.816 billion since the start of 1987.

They told Reuters the two discussed the subject at a   routine meeting.       Sumita told Nakasone he did not feel a rate cut was   appropriate and Nakasone expressed his understanding, the   sources said.

trade	JAPAN CONCERNED AT EC TRADE THREATS - MINISTER   Japan is disappointed at the recent threats   of trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as   the trade situation between the two is improving, Japanese   Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said.       "I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take a   harsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement," he   said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new   centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides.       Last week, foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to   impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical   goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports.       Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC   manufactured goods in the year ended March 31.       "I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through   expansion."       "While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit   between Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified not   by reducing trade through import restrictions or export   restraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade," Tamura said.

The full names of the companies purchased from Gallaher are   &lt;Formatura Iniezione Polimeri Spa>, Genoa and &lt;FIP U.K. Ltd>,   Weybridge.       Consideration for the purchases, which will be based on the   net asset values per share of the companies, has yet to be   finalised but some nine mln stg of the total represents debt   assumed by Glynwed.       FIP is a manufacturer of valves and other pressure pipe   fittings in thermoplastics. Its products are complementary to   those of Glynwed subsidiaries, Durapipe U.K. And Philmac.       The acquisitions appreciably develop and strengthen   Glynwed's strategic position in the thermoplastic pipework   systems market.       The sale by Gallaher reflects a decision to dispose of more   peripheral businesses. Proceeds of the sale will be used in the   continuing expansion of the Gallaher group. Glynwed shares were   up 5p to 494 after the announcement. Gallaher is not quoted on   the London Stock Exchange.
money-fx	KUWAITI DINAR RATES FIRM, AID WINDOW OPEN   Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits   held firm in scattered trading despite a Central Bank decision   to revive limited funding lines, dealers said.       The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily aid   window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened   the facility for three month money, which was available at   seven pct, they said.       It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap   facilities, dealers said.       Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollars   by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered   by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency   arising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension,   dealers said.       However, as one dealer noted: "The market is still   unsettled."       Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business,   traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers   down to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell   quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight.       Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids   of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early   9-1/2, 7-1/2.       One month rates were at the same level after trade at eight   then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and   six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported   offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and   one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close.        The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at   0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. The   spot dinar was 0.27930/40.

In a newspaper advertisement, the company said the offer,   withdrawal rights and proration deadline all expire June 30   unless extended.       The offer is not conditioned on receipt of any minimum   number of shares, Boeing said.  If at least 90 pct of   ARGOSystems' shares are tendered, it said it will buy all   shares, but if less than 90 pct are tendered, it said it plans   to buy only 49 pct in the offer.       Boeing said if less than 90 pct of ARGOSystems' shares are   tendered, but the purchase of all shares tendered along with   the exercise of options it holds would give it over 90 pct of   ARGOSystems, Boeing may buy all shares tendered.       ARGOSystems has granted Boeing an option to buy up to   1,238,311 new shares or a 15.6 pct interest at 37 dlrs each,   and shareholders have granted Boeing an option to purchase up   to 597,885 shares at the same price, or about 8.9 pct of those   now outstanding, without taking the company option into   consideration.

grain:rice:wheat	BOMB THREATS, STRIKES AS FIJI SEES END TRADE BAN   Fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade   ban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of the   country's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressure   for his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.       The government welcomed a decision by the Australian   Waterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to   Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected   government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.       The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,   fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union   decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice   and wheat from an Australian port, the government said.       Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugar   industry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.       In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the   Australian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be   a hoax. Bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience   to press for his reinstatement.
crude	SAUDI ARABIA OPPOSES DRASTIC CHANGE IN OIL PRICE   Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazer   said Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would   not accept a "mad" increase that would drive consumers away.       He told al-Riyadh newspaper, "Saudi Arabia follows a   balanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in   prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad   increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and   find alternative sources (for energy)."       OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world   prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system   aimed to stabilize the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.          OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it   will review its current oil price and production policy.       Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil   prices to remain stable for the next two years.       Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and   production pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The   current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of   15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs   a barrel average.

interest:reserves	U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT   The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.   Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a   further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11   general election, market analysts said.       Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected   number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.       But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now   available to the authorities to support the pound should curb   any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the   ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.       "We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than   we have done hitherto," Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson   said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the   record reserves rise.       He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre   accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the   dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign   exchanges. "We have been playing a very full part ourselves," he   said.       But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on   sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down   its rise, more in the light of local factors.       Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,   said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain   amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last   autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.       U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign   buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as   attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably   equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.       Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower   interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse   the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.       Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves   news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of   currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0   pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.       "The market doesn't want to do anything because of the   election," commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.       Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of   a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had   overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to   have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the   forward market.       The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of   sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth   the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention   reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.       The key three months interbank money market rates eased   about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend   in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves   news, analysts said.       Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was   muted as traders worried about the funding implications of   another huge rise in reserves, they added.       Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut   from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so   long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove   accurate, with another half point later.       Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse   Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be   possible. "Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in   future, rather than this active intervention," he predicted.       Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned   against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut   looked likely.       A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.       "The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political   problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And   has signalled some worry about broad money (growth)," said Robin   Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.       He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in   the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the   European Monetary System.       But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10   or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did   so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.

cpi:gnp	S.AFRICA EXPECTED TO UNVEIL EXPANSIONARY BUDGET   South Africa is expected to unveil   tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year   in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,   economic analysts said.       Faced with competing demands for increased military and   police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black   housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is   expected to raise significantly the government's overall   expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,   the analysts said.       Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state   spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the   financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas   from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.       "Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but   simply raising government spending and increasing the budget   deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation," said Rob Lee,   chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.       South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted   growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of   less than one pct.       Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5   pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to   over 30 pct.       Economists estimate that the government's spending target   will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at   around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit   before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of   GDP.       The government, having consistently overshot its own   spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a   credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the   budget, analysts said.       "The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,"   said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.       Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less   attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using   their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the   money and capital markets.       South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending   will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49   billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5   pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the   IMF.       "The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned," predicted   one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away   from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past   two years.       The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the   political situation and the onset of an economic crisis   triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over   loans to the country in September 1985.       Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling   per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,   government officials say economic growth is the prime   objective.       But private-sector economists caution that the government's   ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is   constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the   current account of the country's balance of payments.       Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5   billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the   nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an   arrangement reached earlier this year with major international   creditor banks.       Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has   little room to manoeuvre.       Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and   budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and   South African Transport Services suggest that major tax   concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.       Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions   for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only   election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.       "This will not be a very exciting budget," commented Harry   Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive   Federal Party. "I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the   sweets were given out before the election."

ship	COLOMBO TO DEFEND WATERS, INDIA READIES FLOTILLA   Sri Lanka today ordered its armed forces   to defend the island's territorial waters as India prepared to   send a flotilla with relief supplies that Colombo says it does   not want for the Tamils in the Jaffna peninsula.       The sudden crisis between Sri Lanka and its giant neighbour   deepened as Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa told   parliament: "We have our territorial limits and nobody can be   allowed to trespass there ...       "President (Junius) Jayewardene has ordered the army, navy   and air force to protect the island and its territorial waters,"   Premadasa said to a round of applause from the house.       In New Delhi an Indian spokesman said the plan to send a   flotilla of 20 small unarmed boats with Red Cross supplies to   Jaffna tomorrow would go ahead despite Colombo's objections.       The confrontation was the latest result of the long and   bitter conflict between Sri Lanka's Buddhist Sinhalese majority   and the Hindu Tamil minority, which has strong ethnic and   cultural links with India's 50 mln Tamils.
money-fx	LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY   The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven   finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies   has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the   economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the   Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.       Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce   any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work   remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting   world economic growth.üside measures to boost growth, he said.          "I think it is possible that there may be scope for a   further reduction in interest rates in Germany," he added, but   stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was   likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.       Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on "a gradual reduction   of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."       He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced   "satisfactory exchange rate stability," in part thanks to heavy   coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and   he was "content" with sterling's exchange rate.       Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May   currency reserves announced today he said, "we have been playing   a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a   very much greater extent than we had done hitherto."       Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may   falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic   commitments underlying the accord.       "Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange   rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their   commitments in Paris ... In this respect." He said the U.S.   Budget deficit was "very important."       Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by   Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson   said, "what is really needed in Japan is an increase in   merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."       "There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural   goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is   wholly unjustified," he said.       Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in "Japan   bashing" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation   package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase   Japanese development aid over the next three years.       Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange   membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.       He said he thought West Germany would instead come under   pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to   jack up faltering economic growth.       In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring   forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts   scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with   the privatisation of German national industries.       On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan   to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to   make progress in Venice.       The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign   debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World   Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.       Lawson said he would seek "to consolidate political backing   for the plan at the Venice summit" and hoped the programme would   be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.       He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase   Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt   provisions.       "First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market   response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this   sort of move than they felt before Citicorp," he said.       U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,   strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.   "They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"   Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to   determine the appropriate size of provisions.       He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be   discussed at the summit. "There is a consensus, which we have to   push further."

It said the joint venture, to be 68.4 pct owned by Grace   and 31.6 pct by Berisford, would have annual sales in 1987 of   over 700 mln dlrs.       Grace said the transaction involves the combination of its   cocoa products division and two Berisford cocoa processing   units, which would be operated under Grace management.       The company said Berisford would contribute its Dutch and   West German cocoa subsidiaries and issue new ordinary shares to   Grace in connection with the transaction.

acq	CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER   CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> intends to proceed with   its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd   &lt;MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>   (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.       ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's   issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.   This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed   bid.       The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand   entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct   stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.          Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holds   just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and   had told CSR it is not a seller.       He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its   operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up   a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.       The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with   Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six   months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the   same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.       CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.          ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond   describing it as a long term investment.       ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is   a leader in building materials, Herbert said.       "We fit better with Monier," he said.       CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its   core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves   into energy several years ago.       Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert   said: "I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to   wonder if Monier is the main target."          Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a   higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.       Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its   original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.       The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on   yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign   shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review   Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.       Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely   to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge   the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.          ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible   acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a   possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the   negotiations foundered on the price.       Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not   think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid   although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.       "Redland is still in the driving seat," said Tim Cohen of   &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having   CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.       Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.

The companies said the agreement is subject to Federal Home   Loan Bank Board approval, expected later this year.       Additionally, the companies said the converted association   would be managed by a board of directors consisting of the six   current Virginia Federal directors and two representatives of   Montrose Holding.       The senior management of Virginia Federal was expected to   continue in office after the conversion, the companies said.
cpi	BRAZIL'S SARNEY RENEWS CALL FOR WAR ON INFLATION   President Jose Sarney today declared "a   war without quarter" on inflation and said the government would   watch every cent of public expenditure.       Sarney, addressing his cabinet live on television, also   reiterated that he intended to remain in power for five years,   until 1990. There has been a long-running political debate   about how long his mandate should be.       Brazil is currently suffering from the worst inflation of   its history. In April monthly inflation reached 21 pct.
gnp	PAKISTAN SAYS GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES   Pakistan says its economy has continued   its recent outstanding performance during the financial year   1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,   investments and energy were causing concern.       GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980   and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according   to a government economic survey.        The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum   and there was an impressive performance in a five point   government program for rural uplift, education and poverty   alleviation, said the survey.       Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news   conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms   damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct   compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now   slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.       The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine   pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.       Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from   2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home   remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs   from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.       More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments   situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in   home remittances, he said.       The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to   2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of   the boost in exports.       He said national investment continued to be small because   of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more   savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the   present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh   five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.

barley:grain	ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION   Italy's barley crop is generally in good   condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the   agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam   said.       First consignments were expected to be available around   mid-June.       Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of   sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,   which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop   because of extreme dryness.       Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low   levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.       Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national   production would be around two pct higher than in the previous   season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.       If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved   in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an   increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.

carcass	CHICKEN NOT MAIN SALMONELLA CAUSE, OFFICIAL SAYS   A representative of the poultry   industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently   the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products or   salads and other mixed foods.       Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries   and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House   Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken   has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither   the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an   increase in outbreaks of the disease.       May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that   between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all   U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct   of outbreaks and dairy products six pct.       May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and   mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.       May said the chicken industry favored moving away from   bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system   better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination   of poultry.       However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for   Food and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be   retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook   chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures   necessary to avoid illness.       Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry   inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.
corn:grain	U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO SPEED UP CORN PAYMENTS   The House Agriculture Committee voted   to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency   payments immediately instead of in the late fall.       A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate   floor last week.       The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow   so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than   late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not   be changed.       Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending   into fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected to   meet stiff resistance in the full House.

money-fx	LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL   The scale of foreign exchange intervention   the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of   Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed   between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in   February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.       Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawson   told reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange rate   stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if he   favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.    May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion   stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.       In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.       Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have been   playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitments   toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.       "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.       Asked which techniques were available to preserve   stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and   interest rate changes could be used to tackle "the market   pressures there are from time to time."       "Interest rate stability is not an objective in that   sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.       Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" by   draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new   issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,   when the market allowed.       This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,   he said.       "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not   necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawson   said. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale."

Gordon said he will decide "in the next few days" whether to   grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by   Samjens Acquisition Corp.       "I do not know how I come down on this preliminary   injunction," Gordon said after listening to arguments by   attorneys for 1-1/2 days.       "It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much   information as I have been. I have to consider what's been   presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be   winners," he said.       Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover   effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally   obtained confidential information about the company to make its   offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if   Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of   Canada, were to succeed.       Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for   Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS> by one dlr per share.   Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid   72 dlrs per share for Burlington.       Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not   granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens   lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would   "kill the offer"       Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the   partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction   were granted. "There's only one Burlington," he said. "If we   cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."       Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in   Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. "We don't want that. We're not in   this for the money," he said.       Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that   information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington   executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o   takeover of Burlington.       "Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider   Jim Ammeen," Nathan said.       An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked   the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge   said he would not rule on the request today.
acq	ALLEGIS &lt;AEG> TO SELL CANADIAN HOTELS   Allegis Corp said it has created a   limited partnership to sell selected hotels in Canada to the   public.       It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350   mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of   September.       The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin   Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis   sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegis   reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that   partnership.             An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in   planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent   corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan   and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston   Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit.       The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which   of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale.       Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in   Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in   Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60   pct of the Westin in Edmonton.       Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement   the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert   unrecognized asset appreciation into cash.       As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,   the money will be used for general corporate needs, the   spokesman said.       Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead   underwriters for to the public offering. The limited   partnership will be offered outside the U.S, Allegis said.

The company said it will gaurantee that almost all of the   issued shares will attain price levels ranging from five to   nine dlrs each for two years after their issuance.       It said Spiridellis had revenues of 3,500,000 dlrs in   calendar 1986.

crude	LUKMAN SEES STABLE OIL PRICE FOR NEXT COUPLE YEARS   The current crude oil price of between   18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple   of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to   keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.       Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade   officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint   by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government   officials said.       They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made   the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third   World debt and industrialised nations.       Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher   energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.       Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the   beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial   countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead   to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he   said.       This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high   prices, he added.       Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major   crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.
interest:money-fx	BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY   The Bundesbank is unlikely to change   credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday   for its last session before the Venice summit, banking   economists and money market dealers said.       The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month   by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is   unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates   in the near future, they said.       The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will   be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.       But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was   usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and   did not necessarily herald any policy moves.       Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today   there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply   growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was   stable against the mark.       Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has   opened a representative office, that the West German economy   was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted   1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.       Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in   a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the   Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a   minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.       "They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe   lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or   Lombard," Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,   Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.       Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said   German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and   around historical lows for West Germany.       A further cut in rates would have little impact on the   economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,   with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.       The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move   on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.   "The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder," he said.       A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in   line with the new structure of money market rates since last   month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.       The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a   diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.       But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it   clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere "eyewash."       Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to   cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary   policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.       But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax   cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget   deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.       "The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in   Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,"   said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.       Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before   Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. "But I   don't expect any convincing measures," he said.       Money market dealers noted that call money continued to   normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday   and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by   month-end distortions.       Call money could come under upwards pressure later this   month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on   behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.   Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.       Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds   tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55   pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,   and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.       But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would   allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not   represent a tightening of policy, however.       Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates   at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full   allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.       On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely   to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency   Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.       Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement   on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the   Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French   occupation this century.       But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come   this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still   to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be   treated for minimum reserve purposes.
alum	ALCAN REDUCES COST OF PLANNED SMELTER   Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it has cut the   expected cost of its planned Laterriere, Quebec, smelter by   using enhanced Grande Baie reduction technology.       The company said the decision to use prebaked anode   technolgy used at its Grande Baie, Quebec, and Sebree, Ky.,   smelters was taken primarily for cost reasons.       As a result, it said, the estimated total cost of the   planned smelter will be held to 450 mln U.S. dlrs, the low end   of the range estimated in mid-May, while the cost of the first   phase was cut to 150 mln dlrs from the projected 175-225 mln   dlrs.
gnp	GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS   The West German government's independent   council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of   the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm   Ost said.       A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor   Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council   said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two   pct was achievable.       It added the council believed "an intensification of the   already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial   policy is not called for."       Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on   West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not   increase.       The government regularly uses the term "changed external   economic factors" when referring to the fall of the dollar,   which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials   have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but   could still fall below the 1986 level.       Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany   agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in   February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.       The stance taken by the experts backs up the official   position of the West German government ahead of next week's   seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be   pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.       West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not   in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due   next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.       The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official   interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.       The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of   between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a   forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.       Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987   predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government   itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,   compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.

carcass	EX-USDA OFFICIAL URGES CHICKEN HANDLING LABELS   A former U.S. Agriculture Department   official urged the department to require that packages of   chicken be labeled with handling and cooking instructions to   protect the public from disease.       Carol Tucker Foreman, President of Foreman and Heidepriem   and a former assistant secretary of agriculture for food and   consumer services, told a House Agriculture subcommittee, "every   hour of every day, 22 Americans become victims of chicken   contaminated with salmonella."       She said every two and a half weeks, an American dies of   salmonellosis or complications arising from it and the   incidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily over   the past several years.       Foreman said USDA should follow a National Academy of   Sciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remind   consumers of preparation procedures necessary to avoid illness.       She urged USDA to require that birds be washed thoroughly   before they are defeathered and that defeathering machines be   cleaned several times a day, that birds be condemned if their   intestines are punctured or there is visible fecal   contamination and that chiller water be changed more often.       Kenneth Blaylock, President of the American Federation of   Government Employees, said a poultry industry recommendation to   move away from the current bird-by-bird inspection could prove   "disastrous." He said a strengthened bird-by-bird inspection with   slower line speeds was the foundation upon which new inspection   techniques should be overlaid.

trade	U.S. WEIGHS LIFTING JAPANESE TRADE CURBS   The White House has completed a new   review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not   yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last   April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.       They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at   Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact   yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.       But there was no hint what the announcement might be.       Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of   Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be   honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.       But they also noted that the White House has said it was   unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the   world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.       The officials added that while the curbs complicated   U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt    Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not   taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.       Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for   Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping   semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs   and to open its own market to U.S. goods.       The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television   sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.       Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as   soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering   to the pact.

crude	ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES   Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he   expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,   probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.       "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).   Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told the   Senate Energy Committee.       Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through   the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells   because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was   also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.       Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section   1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said   geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery   of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.       "The area could contain potentially recoverable oil   resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly   equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides   almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production," Hodel said.       He said production from the new section could begin about   the time Prudhoe Bay production begins to decline in 2000   without endangering caribou or other wildlife in the area.

Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial   and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate   adjustments, rose to 58.373 billion crowns in May from 47.835   billion in April, against 32.443 billion in May 1986.       The Bank said in a statement that public loan transactions   accounted for net capital import of 0.1 billion crowns in May,   with net registered private capital imports of 9.1 billion.       "Of this, the net sale of Danish crown bonds to other   countries totalled about 2.5 billion crowns. There was balance   between the purchase and sale of foreign securities," the   statement added.       The Central Bank said that figures for private bank   reserves and registered capital movements were provisional and   there was no estimate yet of unregistered movements.

dmk:money-fx	LEUTWILER WANTS FIRMER MARK AGAINST SFR   Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of   BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank   president, urged the National Bank to declare its intent of   achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.       In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, "A gradually   rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be   desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with   regard to sustaining Swiss industry."       "Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of   issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect," he   said.       Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central   bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank's   target of monetary stability.       "Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have   to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary   policy," he told shareholders. "Realistically there is in fact no   persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20   pct lower than the Swiss."       A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and   Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a   long period of time.       The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,   not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence   individual parities separately.       Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support   the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central   banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.       "I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a   stronger dollar lies in the United States itself," Leutwiler   said.
acq	SPECTRA-PHYSICS &lt;SPY> MULLS SALE, RESTRUCTURE   Spectra-Physics Inc said it is   considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,   or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of   an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp.       In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,   the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also   said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top   executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base   salary if they stay with the company through August 29.       In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary   of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.       The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two   Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the   Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,   citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley   and Co Inc, that it is "inadequate and unfair from a financial   point of view to the holders of shares," the company said.       The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan   Stanley to "vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any   alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'   investment in the company," the company said.       Among the alternatives the special committee will consider   are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32   dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including   self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of   dividends, Spectra-Physics said.       The "retention plan" for the 52 top officers will pay an   average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.       Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan "in order   to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company   during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the   (Ciba-Geigy) offer."       Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their   cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,   but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons   other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the   company because their salaries have been sharply cut.       Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy   yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging   it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in   violation of securities law and with violating the intent of   July 9, 1985 standstill agreement.       Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of   the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited   takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the   agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20   pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.       Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance   Group Holdings &lt;REL>, which is controlled by New York investor   Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.       Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from   raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unless   another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power.
dlr:interest:money-fx	VOLCKER DEPARTURE REVIVES DLR, INFLATION FEARS   Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a   third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of   Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about   the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem   rising inflation, financial market analysts said.       Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation   fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in   the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough   political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough   campaign against inflation over the next year or two.       "The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with   inflation," said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko   Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for   monetary and financial policy at the Fed.       "A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's   departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will   remain nervous," added Stephen Slifer, money market economist   at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.       This morning's announcement sent the dollar into a   tailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank   intervention in the open currency market.

crude:gas	SMALL RISE SEEN IN U.S. GASOLINE INVENTORIES   U.S. analysts expect the American   Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show   a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended   May 29, oil traders and analysts said.       While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not   rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that   barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the   report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.       Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be   steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil   prices, the analysts said.       Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports   continue at relatively high levels.       Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln   barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.       Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who   looks for a build said, "We have had five weeks of gasoline   demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to   between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand   would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw," he added.       Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw   in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.             The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest   report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline   demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.       But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to   founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3   pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.       Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add   to U.S. stocks.       But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery   runs.       Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between   700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level   reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was   discounted as having a market impact at this time.       "A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,"   one futures analyst said.       Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build   between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels   reported by API for the week of may 22.       The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added   to the nation's inventory.
trade	SHULTZ WELCOMES TOKYO ECONOMIC PACKAGE   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said   the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last   week went further than the U.S. Had expected.       But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic   sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo   changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.       Speaking in a televised news conference linking several   European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the   Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and   global demand.          "There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was   originally thought," said Shultz, speaking from Washington.       "It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked   about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.       "It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe   that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the   economy," he added.       But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news   conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might   decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on   some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:       "These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an   agreement that had been reached between the United States and   Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip   market.       "They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the   agreement that it made become evident."       He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the   situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a   trend on only one month's data.       The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal   computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that   Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by   selling computer chips at below fair market value.       Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do   well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.       Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to   take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold   American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget   deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the   problem.       He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit   would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against   last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would   contain a major reduction.

The company said the sales proceeds will be partly used to   reduce debt. It said it is shifting its focus away from the   development of communities requiring significant equity and   having lengthy projected life cycles.

veg-oil	ACP STATES SAY EC OILS TAX PLAN BREAKS ACCORDS   Developing countries said the European   Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it   went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.       Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific   (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the   exports of 26 ACP countries.       They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures   laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations   between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect   trade between the two sides.       They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking   not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current   Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held   under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.       The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European   currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced   vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could   raise up to two billion Ecus a year.       EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,   are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a   marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on   June 15.       Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are   convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products   made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates   this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its   member country exports.       "We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to   undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these   measures," Wilson said.       The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit   by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it   is approved.       Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only "as a very   last resort," but added that the ACP is in touch with other   countries which oppose the plan.       Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear   Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not   export oils and fats.       Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast,   Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.

meal-feed:oilseed:soy-meal:soybean	SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY   Nearby months in soybean and soymeal   futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of   livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the   new crop outlook bearish, traders said.       "A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried   about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"   one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.       Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for   the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a   Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid   another two cents today to 10 over July futures.       Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,   with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing   to sell, dealers said.       Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief   that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country   movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are   sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half   of the Midwest.       Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime   for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing   the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the   spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.       Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July   soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has   already moved to a premium over the August through October   months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also   move to a July premium later this month, they added.

interest:money-fx	KAUFMAN SAYS GREENSPAN NOMINATION BAD FOR BONDS   Henry Kaufman, managing director of   Salomon Brothers Inc, said the nomination of economist Alan   Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul   Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and   currency markets.       "The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. The   fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward,   interrupted by intermittent rallies," Kaufman said in a   statement. He said the implication for equity markets in   neutral to bullish.       Kaufman said, "Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the office   of the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both   domestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have to   demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before   he can gain full confidence of the financial markets."       Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S.   economy, while his professional skills in the international   area are much more limited, Kaufman noted.       "Consequently, although he is well known abroad, his views   on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially   carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker."
crude	MAJOR U.S. PIPELINE MAY BE CLOSED SEVERAL DAYS   The operator of a major U.S. crude oil   pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be   several days before repairs are made and the system is   functioning again.       Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at   Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, operator of the pipeline through its   subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs   will begin in about five days and expects it to take several   more days to complete.       "At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get   the job done," Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs   will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to   assess because of flooding on the Red River.       The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude   oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days   preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.       The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita   Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red   River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of   severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.       Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline   could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make   up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with   customers to determine their requirements.       Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the    shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.       Monday, after Texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been   closed, West Texas Intermediate crude in the spot market and on   New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures complex rose 20   cts a barrel.

crude:ship	OVERSEAS &lt;OSG> SEES OPEC QUOTAS KEY TO RATES   Overseas Shipholding Group Inc president   Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the   second half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise   accordingly.       Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders   meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak   throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC   oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest   improvement in tanker rates.       Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.             He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as   OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.       For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income   of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln   dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year   ago.       The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,   or 1.45 dlrs per share.             "The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four   years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit   temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker   markets last summer," Hyman said.       He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal   source of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, which   represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.       Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels.

It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the   previous announcement.       These conditions are that offers from registered companies   should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard   differentials have been set in the ICCO's buffer stock rules,   and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and   spot to December arrival/delivery.       The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or   June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate   carrying costs will be taken into account.       The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall   be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers   emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case   of offers emanating from the origins.       The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking   into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking   cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from "cif   landed" and 38.00 pounds sterling from "cif shipping weights"   to "in store") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00   pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said.

Pay 'N Pak said that the proposal from a leveraged buyout   firm had been amended to increase the dividend rate on the   cumulative preferred stock to be received by PNP shareholders   from 13.5 pct to 17.5 pct.       As previoiusly announced, the proposal calls for a   transaction in which PNP shareholders would receive a   combination of 17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation   value of cumulative preferred stock for each common share.             Under the other proposal received from Paul Bilzerian, PNP   shareholders would receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in   cash and 3.33 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative   redeemable preferred stock for each common share, the company   said.       Under the Bilzerian proposal, the dividend rate on the   preferred stock would be set so that in the joint opinion of   the financial advisor to Bilzerian and the financial advisor to   Pay 'N Pak, the preferred stock would trade at its liquidation   value on a fully distributed basis, the company said.
ship	U.S. TO PROTECT ONLY AMERICAN SHIPS   U.S. military forces in the Mideast   Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and   occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to   "non-belligerent" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.       "No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting   all shipping in those waters," Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said   as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the   protective U.S. military presence in the gulf.       Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary   Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral   shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.       "As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are   under our protection with the exception, on a limited   case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military   Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the   region," Sims said.       U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti   ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and   Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that   the the arms would not be used elsewhere.       He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to   U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the   U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian   charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.       Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.       Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its   seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11   Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional   ships and air cover are under consideration.

acq	HOLLLINGER &lt;HLG.TO> PAYING 50 MLN DLRS FOR BUY   Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs   cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned   Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the   annual meeting, confirming a published report.       Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,   Black said, "That would not be wildly inaccurate," although he   declined to disclose the actual cost.       Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper   group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec   City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in   Ontario and Quebec.       Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking   acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000   readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10   such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23   dailies.       "There is really no end to the ones that are available," he   told reporters, although he added that most remaining   acquisition opportunities are in the U.S.       He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,   of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth   quarter.             For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or   better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and   improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest   circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian   dlrs last year.       Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told   reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily   circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about   1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new   Independent daily newspaper.             Knight said The Independent was not affecting the   Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation   of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The   Guardian.       Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post   1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,   including extraordinary gains from previous sales of   discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54   dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an   extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.             Black told shareholders that first quarter operating   earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs   against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.       Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs   from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily   Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter   figures were not disclosed.       He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss   was sharply reduced from last year.

trade	REAGAN SEEKS ROMANIA TRADE CONCESSION   President Reagan called for continued   nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United   States in the face of congressional opposition because of the   Bucharest government's record on human rights.       A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for   continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for   Romania had been "exceptionally difficult" and came after "all   options were seriously considered."       But the statement said that despite concerns about human   rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had   decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate   emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on   human rights practices there.       The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress   requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary   and China.       The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill   legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending   certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on   human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN   for Hungary and China.

The CCC accepted three bonus offers from one exporter which   averaged 40.88 dlrs per tonne, it said.       The barley is for delivery August 15-November 30 in three   shiments of 50,000 tonnes each.       The bonus awards were made to Louis Dreyfus Corporation and   will be paid in the form of commodities from CCC stocks.       An additional 350,000 tonnes of U.S. barley are still   available to Saudi Arabia under the Export Enhancement Program   initiative annnounced on May 15, 1987, it said.
ship	LAST-MINUTE OPPOSITION TO GULF BILL ARISES   House Speaker Jim Wright predicted   passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to   provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but   a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and   conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.       The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th   Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,   which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to   protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags   -- effectively making them American ships.       Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,   congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,   and some charged the policy could lead the United States into   the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.       The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the   Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the   administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on   plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.       The resolution was expected to pass without controversy   today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full   House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal   Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined   in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.       Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the   bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.
grain:wheat	USDA SETS 0/92 PROVISION FOR SOME PRODUCERS   Some producers in the 1987 acreage   reduction program may be eligible for deficiency payments on 92   pct of their enrolled acreage even though none of it is planted   with wheat or other program crops, the U.S. Agriculture   Department said.       The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster   Assistance Act will be available to all eligible winter wheat   producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented   from planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural   disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop   acreage bases subject to flooding on 50 pct of such crop's   permitted acreage.       A producer who did not enroll in the 1987 acreage reduction   program may become eligible by signing-up no later than July   15. Producers will be informed by the local offices when   applications are being accepted, it said.       The department said producers of wheat other than winter   wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from   planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987   because of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if   the farm is located in a county approved by Farmers Home   Administration for emergency loans for such disasters that   occurred in 1986.

The poultry is for shipment June-September and the bonus   was 719.80 dlrs per tone, it said.       The bonus award was made to ConAgra Poultry Co and will be   paid in the form of commodities from the inventory of CCC   stocks.       The purchase completes the Export Enhancement initiative   for Frozen Poultry to Iraq announced December 22, 1986.

The poultry is for shipment November, 1987, through August,   1988, and the bonus was 473.99 dlrs per tonne for the frozen   fryer legs. The bonuses were made to Gress Foods, Inc (5,000   tonnes), and Serva International Ltd (5,000 tonnes).       The subsidies will be paid to the exporters in the form of   commodities from CCC stocks.       An additional 8,500 tonnes of frozen poultry remain   available to Egypt under the Export Enhancement Program   initiative announced Dec 19, 1986, and Feb 27, 1987, the   department said.
copper	PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SEES STRONGER COPPER PRICES   Phelps Dodge Corp officials said good   fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices   for the metal.       In an interview with Reuters, chairman G. Robert Durham   said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices   up eight to nine pct on the New York Commodities Exchange last   month.       "Our customers in this country are living off the tailgates   of our trucks," he said, referring to tightness of supply and   strong demand. "The fundamentals are good."             Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said;   "All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored."       He said copper supplies are lower than they have been for   almost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest on   record behind 1984, he said.       Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with   annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.             During the interview, executive vice president Douglas   Yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before   the copper price rose "because there aren't that many new   projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,   will continue to grow modestly."       Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to   more than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound   rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for   Phelps Dodge, the company said.       "Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction   and other areas," Yearley said.             New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine   owned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's   &lt;BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's   own expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production   shortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.       Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located   Chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production   at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter. The   company's total production costs, including depreciation but   before interest and corporate expense, should be below 50 cts a   pound by late 1989 or 1990, he said.
lumber	CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES TO HAITI AMENDED   The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC)   has amended its Export Credit Guarantee Program line to Haiti   to add one mln dlrs in guarantees for sales of U.S. wood   products, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.       The action increases the value of export credit guarantees   for wood products to Haiti from 1.8 to 2.8  mln dlrs and the   total value of export credit guarantees authorized to Haiti for   the current fiscal year for all commodities to 12.0 mln dlrs,   the department said.       All sales must be registered and exports completed by Sept   30, 1987, it noted.

grain:wheat	U.S. WHEAT IN SENEGAL MARKET -- USDA   After a highly favorable reception of   a trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flour   last February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery of   a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.   Agriculture Department said.       In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the   department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat   under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local   opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been   delaying deliveries.       As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well   as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers   and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.       The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal   remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that   had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French   wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.

trade	INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY   With more private investment, not more   protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive   with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two   congressional agencies said today.       The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of   Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing   there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.   textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for   optimism than a few years ago.       "While textile producers are making significant   investments, they could do more," OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan   budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan   guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than   increased trade protection which could lead to foreign   retaliation.       CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,   first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for   profits and investments of domestic firms.       Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the   agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against   congressional approval of protectionist textile quota   legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other   Asian textile producing countries.       President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill   but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is   expected to be voted on in the House this year.       However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of   a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles   showed a weakening of support for the legislation.       Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign   producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production   equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic   markets, Kelly said.       He added that private investment in the textile and   clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh   the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.       Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of   textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct   while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.       "The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by   new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the   industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets   that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research   indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,   and that exports can be expanded," Kelly said.

acq:copper	PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION   Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert   Durham said the company is prepared to make another large   non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the   near future.       In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was   examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.       He declined to name the companies but said a deal could   occur as soon as the second half of 1987.             Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in   the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals   Co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires   among other products.       The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and   eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper   operations.       Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs   to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about   100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.             Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different   economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good   management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly   deal, he added.       "We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or   about a perfume company," he said. "We want a good basic   industrial company that will fit into our management   structure," Durham said.             During the interview, Durham and other executives also said   continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to   higher prices for the metal.       "In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price   (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new   projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,   will continue to grow modestly," said executive vice president   Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of   producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50   cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and   corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.       Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now   compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts   said.       Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been   for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.       He declined to project results for the second quarter or   year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in   copper prices in the last month will help results.       Durham said last month that the second quarter should match   the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln   dlrs or 49 cts a share.       First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,   reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased   copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also   acquired last year.       Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75   dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.

The IMC said in a statement the ICO is an important   instrument for ensuring producers obtain an adequate price.   Mexico currently produces around five mln 60-kilo bags of   coffee per year.       Brazil said during a meeting of coffee producers in Rio de   Janeiro over the weekend that it would consider leaving the ICO   if its export quota was reduced by the organization.
acq:crude:nat-gas	AMOCO &lt;AN> SAYS DOME &lt;DMP> BUY GOOD FOR CANADA   Amoco Corp's wholly owned Amoco   Canada Petroleum Co Ltd said its proposed 5.22-billion-   Canadian-dlr acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd will benefit   Canada just like the foreign investment that made possible   commercial development of Alberta's oilsands.       Amoco Canada president T. Don Stacy told an oilsands   conference that "Amoco Canada has presented the solution to the   Dome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and   determination to make that solution work."       The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian   nationalists, who want a Canadian buyer for Dome.       Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share   offer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership of   the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.       He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs of   Dome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest in   Amoco Canada-Dome properties all available cash flow for five   years after the acquisition.

ship	U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION   The U.S. House of Representatives    approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to   provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not   place any restrictions on its actions.       The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds   of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance   of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to   defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators   oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.       The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th   Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,   which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11   Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --   effectively making them American ships.       The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and   Republican leadership as well as by the administration --   required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a   report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to   protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.       It did not, however, place any restrictions on the   administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and   thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.       The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this   week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.       Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a   first step toward a greater congressional involvement in   formulating policy.       But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the   administration to address tough policy questions in the report.
crude:ship	U.S. SENATE TEAM WANTS MULTINATIONAL GULF FORCE   The leaders of a U.S. Senate team probing   American defense strategy in the MidEast Gulf said they favored   a multinational force to keep oil flowing through the waterway.       Sen. John Glenn and John Warner, in Kuwait as part of a   Gulf Arab tour, said at a news conference that top officials in   the area appeared ready to discuss extra facilities needed if   the U.S. upgraded its defense role.       The Senate team next heads for the United Arab Emirates,   their last stop on a fact-finding mission prompted by Reagan   administration plans to let half of Kuwait's 22-tanker fleet   fly the U.S. flag.       Glenn and Warner said the U.S., Britain and France, should   explore the possibility of a unified Gulf force.       "The American ships, the British ships, the French ships now   talk to each other and all we've got to do is formalize this   arrangement," Warner said.       Glenn said a multinational force could be effectively   deployed within 24 hours of a decision.       Glenn voiced a preference for a United Nations   multinational force, or failing that, an American, British,   French force with cooperation from the Gulf Arab states.       Warner voiced concern that the Soviet Union might use the   situation in the Gulf to raise its presence. "And,   unequivocally, all GCC states we have talked with, have said   that would not be in the interests of the Arabian peninsula."
crude	COLOMBIAN GROUP SUSPENDS BOMBINGS OF PIPELINES   A Colombian group announced the suspension   of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levy   of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln   dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>.       There was no indication the government would meet the   conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army   (ELN).       According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried   out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.       The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have   caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.       In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one   dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a   condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.       Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per   day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating   Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.       If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up   to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the   penalty.

The locals, part of United Steelworkers of America,   represent 2,600 production and maintenance workers. No date has   been set for the talks, the spokesman replied to a query.       The spokesman said talks were still ongoing with the two   other striking locals, representing 600 office and technical   workers. Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down   since the strike started May 9.       Each of the five locals has a separate contract that   expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.       The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and   110,000 long tons of lead last year, while the Sullivan mine at   Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for   processing at Trail.       Revenues from Trail's smelter totaled 356 mln Canadian dlrs   in 1986.
copper	PHELPS DODGE SEEKS TO DIVERSIFY MORE FROM COPPER   Phelps Dodge Corp is prepared to make   another large non-copper acquisition and a deal could be struck   in the near future, chairman G. Robert Durham said.       Durham told Reuters the company was examining potential   candidates but not yet talking with any. Any acquisition must   have a different economic cycle to copper, he said.       Phelps Dodge, the largest U.S. copper producer, last year   paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals Co which makes carbon   black used in rubber and tires. The purchase was part of a   strategic plan to diversify and then match earnings between   copper and non-copper operations.       The company could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to   buy another non-copper firm, Durham said, citing 100 mln dlrs   of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.
crude:ship	EC WATCHING GULF WAR DEVELOPMENTS   The European Community (EC) should   watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and   their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner   Nicolas Mosar said today.       Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the   Gulf, Mosar warned, "An escalation in the Gulf would increase   tensions in the oil market."       "But I do not want to be alarmist," he told a news conference   after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.       He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had   declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first   three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last   year. "There are also other potential sources of supplies in the   world," he added.       The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the   ministers' meeting, he added.       A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil   supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual   meeting on June 19, he said.       But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC   foreign ministers, diplomats said.       West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm   for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant   ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil   supplies.

Hard red spring wheat accounts for most acreage with 6.0   mln estimated for this year, little changed from last year.   Oats acreage of 1.95 mln is unchanged on last year and barley   area of 5.9 mln is also similar to last year. Rapeseed planting   of an estimated 3.24 mln is expected five pct up on 1986. The   south and south central areas of Alberta lacked moisture with   germination patchy at best. Growth prospects in northern areas   are generally in the good to very good range.      Soil moisture is better in the north central and Peace   areas, the wheat pool said.

Dlrs in April from a revised 89 mln   dlrs in March, and 224 mln dlrs in April 1986, in a smoothed   seasonally-adjusted measurement, the Statistics Department   said.       The March figure was revised from 69 mln dlrs.       The department said in a statement seasonally adjusted, but   non-smoothed figures, showed a deficit of 99 mln dlrs against   76 mln dlrs in March and 230 mln dlrs in April 1986.       Totally unadjusted figures show a deficit of 83 mln dlrs   against 164 mln dlrs in March, revised from 178 mln dlrs, and   compared with 262 mln in April 1986.       The smoothed seasonally adjusted series shows a surplus on   merchandise trade of 145 mln dlrs against 135 mln dlrs in March   and 30 mln dlrs in April 1986.       Seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed figures show a   merchandise trade surplus of 132 mln dlrs against a 148 mln dlr   surplus in March and a 14 mln dlr surplus in April 1986.       Unadjusted merchandise figures show a surplus of 151 mln   dlrs against a 5.0 mln dlr (revised from 10 mln dlr) deficit in   March and a 31 mln dlr deficit in March 1986.       The smoothed seasonally adjusted deficit on invisibles was   234 mln N.Z. Dlrs against 236 mln dlrs in March and 255 in   April 1986.       The seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed deficit on   invisibles was 240 mln dlrs against 229 mln dlrs in March and   245 mln dlrs in April 1986. The unadjusted deficit on   invisibles was 234 mln dlrs against 158 mln dlrs, revised from   168 mln dlrs, in March and 231 mln dlrs in April 1986.       Seasonally adjusted export and import figures were not   available.       The department said these figures show a continuing   improvement in the current account deficit, caused mainly by an   improvement in the balance on merchandise trade which has now   being in surplus since november 1985.
strategic-metal	STRONG DEMAND FOR PERU BISMUTH IN JAN/MAY   Very strong demand from all markets   including, recently, Japan has resulted in Peru's bismuth   exports showing an impressive increase in January/May 1987,   Peru's state owned mining industry's marketing arm Minpeco S.A.   Said.       In a statement released by its London office, Minpeco said   Peruvian customs figures for bismuth exports for the first five   months were 574.8 tonnes compared with 160.7 tonnes in the same   period of 1986 and 483.4 tonnes during the whole of 1986,   Minpeco said.       A breakdown of the figures showed Peru exported 296.4   tonnes of bismuth to the U.S. During Jan/May 1987 compared with   127.0 during the whole of 1986. Other recipients were Peoples   Republic of China 110.4 (100.0), Holland 100.2 (150.0), USSR   50.0 (50.0) and other areas 17.8 tonnes (56.4).       Sales to the U.K., West Germany, France and other Western   and Eastern European countries are hidden under the heading   Holland as Minpeco sells to customers in these countries from   stocks the company normally holds in Rotterdam, the statement   said.

carcass	U.S. MEAT INDUSTRY LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN IN JAPAN   The U.S. meat industry has launched an   aggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumer   awareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government to   relax current beef import quotas.       U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrs   annually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as high   as six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas were   removed and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of the   attributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat Export   Federation said at a press conference today.       Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through the   Agriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)   program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan was   launched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April.       "The promising Japanese beef market could be one of the   bright spots for U.S. agricultural exports," said Philip Seng,   Asian Director for the Federation. "We supply and they (Japan)   buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want to   buy more," he said.       Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limits   total Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.   imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expanding   U.S. beef shipments to Japan.       The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy   Japanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreement   expires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to get   underway this fall.       The Reagan administration has called for an end to the   quotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said they   would not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure.       Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters that   they do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but that   they hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.       High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected market   has also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industry   officials said.       Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.   tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrs   for a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat association   said. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrs   per pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb.       Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beef   per year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,   officials said.       Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000   tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and a   decrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mln   tonnes.

Azpurua spoke to reporters after meeting representatives of   the kreditanstalt fur wiederaufbau (kfw) bank of germany, who   tommorrow will sign a agreement to grant 100 mln marks (54.9   mln US dlrs) in credits to venalum.

"this proves we are achieving our goal of reestablishing   the financial flows to the country," said azpurua.       The credits would go to the installation of a fifth   production line in venalum, one of three state aluminum   companies, which produces primarily for the export market.
ship	U.S. HOUSE PASSES MIDEAST GULF BILL   The House today approved a bill   requiring the Reagan administration to report to Congress on   its Mideast Gulf policy but not restricting its actions.       The vote in favor was despite a last-minute revolt by an   alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who   sought to defeat it as a signal that a growing number of   legislators oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.       In the Senate, a leading Republican senator, former Senate   Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark Hatfield of Oregon, said   he would try to prevent consideration of the bill.       He said he will put a so-called "hold" on the bill until he   finds out whether the War Powers Act applies to protecting   Kuwaiti tankers.       Congressional leaders complain they were not consulted   about plans to put the U.S. flag on Kuwaiti ships and some   charged the policy could lead the U.S. into the Iran-Iraq war.       Conservative Republicans said increasing the U.S. military   obligation in the gulf would place impossible burdens on   American servicemen and equipment, and warned it could lead to   war.       "It is a real snake pit at best and a powder keg that will   blow sky-high at worst," said Wisconsin Rep. Toby Roth.
money-fx	NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES   Currency futures are likely to move   higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan   announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as   Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated   as his replacement, currency analysts said.       Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,   analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between   now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.       In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to   the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,   analysts said.       Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing   a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in   Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a   technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,   analysts said.             "Disappointment of European central bankers over the   appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar   lower," said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol   Mackoff.       "The international community will not like this   appointment," as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.   budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and   that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to   reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David   Horner.        Furthermore, "that Greenspan was not named two months ago   suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --   and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"   Horner said.       A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures   prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated   only by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the G-7   summit, he said.       But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may   be at an impasse, analysts said.       Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither   planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the   U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.       The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit   as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.       Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its   budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the   dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.       However, "the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing   changes," Horner said.       Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane   said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of   their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.       For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen   futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September   marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss   francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.

KOREAN WHOLESALE PRICES UP 0.4 PCT IN MAY   South Korea's wholesale price index, base   1980, rose 0.4 pct to 127.0 in May after a 1.1 pct rise in   April and was 1.5 pct higher than in May 1986, the Bank of   Korea said.       The May consumer price index, which has the same base, rose   1.4 pct to 149.1 after a 0.3 pct gain in April, for a   year-on-year rise of 3.5 pct.       Wholesale prices rose 2.0 pct in the first five months of   1986, while consumer prices rose by 3.2 pct. Bank officials   said the rises were due to a strong yen which made imports of   Japanese parts, raw and intermediary materials more expensive.

The new rate, if unmatched by other banks, will be the   lowest among Australian trading banks. Other primes range from   16.25 to 17.5 pct.       Australian prime rates have now retreated from a recent   peak of 19 pct in October in line with declining money market   levels. Citibank said its reduction reflected the decline.
strategic-metal	CHINA MOVES TO STABILISE WORLD TUNGSTEN PRICES   China is moving to stabilise world prices   of tungsten after fluctuating prices this year affected the   country's export earnings, the China Daily said.       The paper quoted industry officials as saying they would   fix export prices on the basis of the world market, stop   smuggling and encourage producers to reduce exports.       Current world prices range from 49 to 55 dlrs per tonne   unit, but China suffered heavy losses when the price slumped to   39 dlrs earlier this year, it said.       Some 45 pct of world tungsten exports come from China, but   the country imports high-grade tungsten products.
acq	AUSTRALIA'S ANSETT TO TAKE 20 PCT OF AMERICA WEST   Australia's &lt;Ansett Airlines> will   exercise an option to acquire 20 pct of America West Airlines   Inc &lt;AWAL.O> for about 31.5 mln U.S. Dlrs, &lt;Ansett Transport   Industries Ltd> managing director Peter Abeles said.       Exercise, involving the purchase of about three mln new   America West shares for 10.50 U.S. Dlrs each, was scheduled to   be finalised in July or August, he said in a statement.       Abeles said Ansett would become the largest single   shareholder in what he said was the fastest growing airline in   the United States. America West is based in Phoenix, Arizona.       Under the terms of the option agreement, Ansett would have   the right to maintain its 20 pct position in the event of   future stock sales, but could not go beyond 20 pct unless so   requested by America West, Abeles said.       America West would retain the right of first refusal if   Ansett offered any of the shares for sale.       In addition, Ansett would gain one board seat, he said.       Ansett Transport Industries wholly owns Ansett Airlines,   one of Australia's two major domestic airlines, and is in turn   owned 50/50 by Abeles' international transport group TNT Ltd   &lt;TNTA.S> and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd &lt;NCPA.S>.

The world shipping recession and the yen's appreciation   against the dollar depressed May orders, he said.
trade	SHULTZ PREDICTS RAPID NARROWING OF U.S. TRADE GAP   Secretary of State George Shultz said   the U.S. Would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster   than many predicted, and the consequences for its trade   partners might be traumatic.       "The U.S. Economy will inevitably make the adjustment   necessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance in   order to service our growing foreign debt," he told a conference   attended by the six members of the Association of Southeast   Asian Nations and their leading Western friends.       "In my view, this will happen more rapidly than many   observers now predict."       "The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is   becoming less effective," Shultz said.       "It is not arithmetically possible for every country in the   world to be a net exporter at the same time. The U.S. Deficit,   which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into which   everyone's export-led strategy for growth has gone."       "The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on   this deficit, so something will have to give and it will be   possibly a traumatic experience," he added.       "While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew   protectionist policies, you must act too," Shultz said.       "I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave   our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open   their doors wider," he told the group, which included   representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and   the European Community.

acq	DAIRY FARM BIDS 146.6 MLN STG FOR 22 PCT KWIK SAVE   &lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings   Ltd> said in a statement it is making a tender offer for 22 pct   of Kwik Save Discount Group Plc &lt;KWIK.L> of Britain for a total   146.6 mln stg.       Dairy Farm said it will offer to buy up to 32.58 mln Kwik   Save shares at 4.50 stg each.       The offer will bring Dairy Farm's stake in Kwik Save to 25   pct from the present 3.5 pct, or 5.25 mln shares.       The offer, which will begin on Monday and ends June 30,   requires that the shares tendered will bring its stake to at   least 15 pct.       Dairy Farm said it will finance the acquisition by placing   89 mln shares with affiliate Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd   &lt;JARS.HK> at 5.10 H.K. Dlrs each for a total of 454 mln dlrs.       The placement will raise Jardine Strategic's stake in Dairy   Farm to 39.75 pct from the current 35.3 pct.       It said the Kwik Save purchase will also be financed with a   loan from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK>. It   did not give the size of the loan but it said it would raise   its net bank borrowings to a maximum of 2.2 billion H.K. Dlrs.       Dairy Farm said it would reduce its bank borrowings by the   proceeds from the previously announced sale of its office   building in Sydney for 625 mln dlrs.       It will consider raising additional capital, most probably   through a placement of convertible preference shares in the   Euromarket, it added.       Company chairman Simon Keswick said the U.K. Market "offers   attractive opportunities for competitively priced food   retailers" and that "a strategic investment in Kwik Save offers   the best vehicle to pursue those opportunities."

carcass:corn:grain:livestock:meal-feed:oilseed:rapeseed:sorghum:soy-meal	JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT   Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct   to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a   year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.       The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for   poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef   cattle raising, Ministry officials said.       Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87   against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were   217,554 tonnes against 224,101.       Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes   from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.       The officials said corn imports rose because the world   surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced   Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in   1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.       Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87   from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from   18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due   to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as   Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.       Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and   the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.       The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from   increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.       Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against   528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct   from 2.1 pct.

Bank officials have said the bank regards the overdraft   reference rate, based on short-term rate trends, as its key   prime lending rate to corporate customers. The loan reference   rate is based on longer term trends.       The bank is the latest to cut prime rates in recent days   following a continuing decline in market rates. Other prime   rates now range from 16 pct to 17.5 pct.

gnp	S.KOREA SEES GNP GROWTH MORE THAN 10 PCT THIS YEAR   South Korea's gross national product (GNP)   will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise   further as long as the current account surplus continues to   widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.       Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his   GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will   remain stable.       The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.       GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and   1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.       GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.       In the first four months of this year, the current account   swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294   mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.       "What the Minister said does not imply any major economic   policy change," a Ministry spokesman told Reuters. "But he tried   to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic   (future) ... A high won era."       South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won   should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they   plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation   against the dollar.       The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05   against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared   with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.       The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three   days earlier this month while an International Monetary Fund   team held talks here to discuss revaluation.

The decline in production in the nine months to end-March   reflected mainly a sharp dip early in the fiscal year, when low   oil prices and high marginal excise rates led to a reduction of   output from Bass Strait, department figures in its Major Energy   Statistics publication show.

"Clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of other   proposed share issues so as to enter the market at the best   opportunity," Prebble said.       "We are in no particular rush to sell our shares in Air New   Zealand," he said.       "Our aim is to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer. If that   means waiting for a while, then so be it," Prebble said.       He said Air New Zealand expects to release its results soon   for the year to March 31 1987. He said he was confident it   would post an excellent profit.       Prebble said Air New Zealand was successful but its ability   to prosper in future was hampered by its   wholly-government-owned status.       Prebble said access to new sources of capital would   increase its ability to expand and develop.       This sale announcement follows the public float in March of   around 13 pct of the &lt;Bank of New Zealand Ltd>.

They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting   EC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans   feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after   Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.       Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the   personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.       Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers   would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.       Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top   personal computers would continue at last year's level of   12,000 to 16,000 units a year.       Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged   failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor trade.
interest	BELGIUM CUTS TREASURY CERTIFICATE RATES   The Belgian National Bank said it cut   one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by   0.10 points, effective immediately.       The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month   rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the   central bank said in a telex.       A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made   after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and   was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct   discount rate.       The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially   the three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main   monetary policy instrument for the last two years.       The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather   than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently   little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.       The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on   June 5, also by 0.10 points.

The   contractual ratio is 30 pct heavy crude to 70 pct light.       Japanese demand for heavy crude oil has increased   substantially since the All Japan Seaman's Union ceased sailing   into the northern Mideast gulf last month, causing problems   with liftings of heavy Kuwait and Khafji crudes.
crude	INDONESIA CUTS JULY CRUDE SUPPLIES TO JAPAN   Indonesia's state oil company, Pertamina,   has informed its affiliated Japanese companies that crude oil   supplies will be 40 pct less than contractual volumes in July,   a spokesman for an affiliated company said.       He said the allocations were in line with Indonesia's   production ceiling under its current OPEC quota, so they might   be increased if OPEC ratifies a production rise next week.       Allocations of Indonesia's main traded crude, Minas, had   been cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct, he said.       Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct.       Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling.       Oil traders said Indonesian grades were already trading   above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market   due to strong demand from Japan and the U.S. And tight   supplies.       A cargo of Duri loading in July was reportedly traded   yesterday at 70 cents over its osp of 15.60 dlrs per barrel and   Minas is trading about 20 cents higher, they said.

The slight rise partly reflected the repayment last month   of France's outstanding 11.95 billion francs of debt owed to   the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).       It also reflected a negative 314 mln franc position with   France's Exchange Stabilisation Fund after intervention   purchases of 10.6 billion francs during May.       Foreign currency holdings fell 7.28 billion francs to   124.58 billion while ECU holdings fell by 5.55 billion francs   to 58.52 billion due to the repayment of part of France's debt   owed to the FECOM and Stabilisation Fund operations, the   ministry said.       Claims on the IMF rose 1.14 billion francs to 18.97   billion, including a 385 mln franc increase in France's reserve   position with the IMF and a 751 mln franc rise in holdings of   Special Drawing Rights.

Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the   revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in   priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion   at the end of 1986.       The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included   banking group Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA>, which began its   two-week public flotation last Monday.       The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as   the private sale of telephone group &lt;Cie Generale de   Constructions Telephoniques> (CGCT) since its denationalisation   scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers   Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA>, it added.       The government has pledged to privatise 66 state-owned   industrial, banking and insurance companies by 1991.       Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the   near future are television network TF-1 later this month and   banking group Cie Financiere de Suez &lt;FSPP.PA> in the autumn.       The ministry said TF-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a   third of the government's programme would have been completed   in less than nine months.       Balladur on Sunday rejected press and opposition charges   that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched   too low.       He said that the average premium of shares trading on the   Bourse was between 15 and 30 pct over their offer price. This   compared with premiums of between 60 and 80 pct on similar   share flotations in Britain.
sugar	FIJI MAKES SUGAR PAYMENT TO GET HARVEST STARTED   Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim   payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a   move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop   under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.       Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop   indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record   501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)   crop year.       The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced   486,790 tonnes.       For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed   harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the   Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.       Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make   a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for   the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers   for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills   by June 23.       Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June   23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.       The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the   full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds   received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.       Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of   23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to   the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled   Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.       However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of   14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the   forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane   harvested by November 30, he said.       Ganilau said, "This will be at least one month in advance of   the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The   balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the   end of crushing."       Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an   estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)   for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.   The FDB rejected this request.       Ganilau said, however, "The bank is prepared to carefully   consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of   hardship on a case-by-case basis."       In response to a further demand that all soldiers be   removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army   would restrict its presence in the cane areas.       He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to   harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions   to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the   commencement of harvest.       Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had   indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,   he added.

jobs	U.K. UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS BELOW THREE MLN IN MAY   U.K. Unemployment fell a record   provisional, seasonally-adjusted 64,300 in May to a total 2.95   mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, the Employment Department   said.       In April, seasonally-adjusted unemployment fell by an   upwardly revised 21,600 to 3.02 mln or 10.9 pct, it said.       The unadjusted jobless total in May, including school   leavers, alos fell a record 121,000 to 2.99 mln or 10.8 pct   from April's 3.11 mln, 11.2 pct.       May was the eleventh successive decline from a peak last   summer of 11.6 pct, the Employment Department said.       "Unemployment has fallen to under three mln for the first   time in over three years. The May fall of 64,000 was the   largest drop since records were first kept (in 1948),"   Employment Minister Norman Fowler said.       All regions have seen above average falls in long term   unemployment during the past year, he added.       The last time the adjusted total of unemployed was below   three mln was July 1984, while the unadjusted total was last   below this level in June 1983.

The April index, base 1980, was set at a provisional,   seasonally-adjusted 197.3, up from 194.8 in March.       But the underlying rise was 7.75 pct, up 0.25 pct from   March and back to the same level seen late last year.       The underlying rise is adjusted for factors such as   back-pay and timing variations.       Unit wage costs in U.K. Manufacturing industry rose one pct   in the year to April, after an upward revised rise of 0.7 pct   in the period to March, the Department of Employment added.       In the three months to end-April, such costs were 0.9 pct   higher, year-on-year, compared with a rise of 1.2 pct in the   three months to March.       Manufacturing productivity in April was 6.1 pct higher than   a year ago after a downward revised 6.8 pct increase in March.   In the last three months period manufacturing productivity was   up 6.7 pct, having increased 6.5 pct in the first quarter.

A broad cross-section of members of parliament voiced their   opposition to the tax during a debate in the lower house   yesterday on the basis of possible retaliation from the U.S.   And on the potentially damaging effect on Third World   countries.       State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Rene Van Der Linden   said the government was against the tax although it noted   deepening EC financial difficulties.       "It is difficult to be against the tax and against extra   finance. The EC members have to make a choice," Van Der Linden   said.       However, he denied the government had dropped its   opposition to the proposed tax or altered its position.

Staffan Paues, President of the new Brussels-based joint   venture company Diamant Boart Stratabit SA (DBS), told a news   conference that the merged firm would be able to offer products   for all types of drilling operations.       He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from   recession was under way in the oil and gas industries.       "Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment"   Paues said.       DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings   together Sandvik's wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp   of Houston and Diamant Boart's petroleum activities in Europe,   North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa.       Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall   in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back   exploration activities. Officials said the complementary   character of the two firms' operations was a further reason.

lead:ship	VESSEL LOST IN PACIFIC WAS CARRYING LEAD   The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier   Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was   carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,   a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.       He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.       Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said   the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South   Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.   Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning   trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental   news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low   stocks.       Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates   could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this   depended on the quality of the concentrates.       A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply   pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies   there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at   one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being   held at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and   Smelting Ltd.

coffee	RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA   European coffee traders and roasters   may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee   Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting   here this week, traders and officials told Reuters.       Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the   possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the   world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the   next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.       "The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's   attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, " one said.       However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,   which began here today and is to continue to the end of the   week, has revealed gaps in the European position on   re-introducing quotas.       Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against   re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in   favour with the single proviso that there had to be some   formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing   countries.       The roasters said the positions were generally fairly   close, and problems with some Government officials.       Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized   Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.       Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota   re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.       "Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the   end of the week to at least present a common European Community   (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the   International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July," one trader said.       "We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not   only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,"   one official said.       "We have learned that we can live without the quotas that   were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the   stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not   simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as   quota allocation is concerned," he added.       Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the   likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly   pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.       "Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the   consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota   re-introduction, " he said.       "The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new   Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least   negotiable position of any of his predecessors," one trader   said.       "However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of   the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under   a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which   gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota   meeting in September," the official said.

grain:rice:sugar	INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS   Indonesia rejected World Bank   recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as   the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5   billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.       Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks   distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met   at The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bank   for this free trade, open economy view is weak."       The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the   largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural   growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.       The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked   and the subsidies are a waste of money.       Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides   an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were   needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,   exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as   assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.       Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers   should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the   government would continue to maintain production targets for   "strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar.       The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's   drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double   the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country   would save money by importing the commodity.       However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need   to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar   industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.       He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the   agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry   develop and because of "over-production and price intervention   in the developed nations."

corn:grain	BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS   U.S. House and Senate budget   negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached   yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending   on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.       The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4   billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.       The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the   farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a   total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.       The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture   committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in   agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets   without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior   Congressional aides told Reuters.       Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find   the budget savings.       Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains   subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat   and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs   and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.       House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has   said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.       But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to   be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and   a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said   freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major   grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget   savings Glickman claims.       Another area where Glickman and other have said budget   savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,   ARP, levels for wheat and corn.       However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand   within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop   wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30   pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most   commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.       Congressional sources said the only way to achieve   significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost   the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said   singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as   unfair to one commodity.       Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most   likely to eventually look for budget savings are some   tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible    adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.       Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion   but not enough, they said.       Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture   committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on   all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price   support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the   Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.       This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau   Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.

That was up from 2,255,000 the previous week.
crude	OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS   Some OPEC states are unhappy about the   prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose   great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price   and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.       They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference   presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances   about price differentials making some of their crudes   uncompetitive.       There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that   OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,   to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.       But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price   differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market   signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.       "All OPEC members can make a good case for changing   differentials," said one analyst with a major oil company. "But   at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave well   alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."       Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw   sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished   customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,   marketing incentives have helped their sales.       Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by   means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside   better priced grades in a "package."       Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least   for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should   change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for   fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At   its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed   prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference   point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985   when members offered discounts to attract customers.       OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8   mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter   and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend   or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.       Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not   mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr   target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,   analysts say.       The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one   non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export   crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.   Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.       Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil   exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say   only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at   official prices, with some of the rest included in processing   or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.       Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,   when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to   pay the new prices.      Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude   -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --   was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.       In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below   its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,   due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has   risen.       Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say   its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.       But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort   Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the   differentials question in Vienna.       "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which   holds the presidency, raised the issue," he said.
money-fx:nzdlr	NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE   Analysts said they were surprised at   the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for   fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy   statements and positive for the economy.       Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus   for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs   against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.       Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus   was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'   forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.       Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters   before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a   2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.       The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and   the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,   the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite   lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more   confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.       However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying   the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will   move lower.       The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after   hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget   release.       Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share   market, despite an increase in the contribution of company   taxation to revenue figures.       One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus   announcement could push the share market up by 50 points   tomorrow.       The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a   continuation of existing policies, and the absence of   traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively   by overseas investors, another said.       But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax   avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share   market, particularly multi-national companies.       The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,   through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The   requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln   N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.       Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and   there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another   economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely   credible.       "Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,"   he said.       An election is due before the end of September.

income:interest:jobs:reserves	U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS   Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed   the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current   nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.       A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing   production data showed that the economy is still strong and   does not need a fillip from lower rates.       News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,   taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money   supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist   arguments against easier credit, they said.       "The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back   all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money   growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near   term," said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.       Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's   mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies   said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.   Rates.       It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that   a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such   optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which   mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's   strength.       The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm   about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment   rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly   replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying   average earnings in April, dealers said.       The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending   rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank   of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset   the impact on domestic money supply of its current   intervention.       "The gilt market reaction was correct," said Bill Martin,   chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.       "That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very   good state indeed," Skeoch said.       "There's no reason to get worries about inflationary   pressures because they're very subdued." Unit wage cost rises   were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to   April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings   which were potentially inflationary, he added.       "I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major   problem," agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.       But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried   about the funding implications of recent intervention.       He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets   earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that   the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now   looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try   to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.       However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson   Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still   trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal   higher inflation this year.       "Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As   long as that continues we're okay," he added.
money-fx	FED GOVERNOR SEGER SEES CURRENCY STABILITY   Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha   Seger said there were signs of helpful stability in foreign   exchange markets in recent weeks.       "I think we are beginning to see more calm in those markets,"   Seger told reporters after a speech to the U.S. League of   Savings Institutions.       "I think it is very healthy when you can get into a period   of stability," she said.       She said market forces have a major influence on exchange   rates and said she did not know the right value for the dollar   against the Yen or the Mark.       Seger told the Savings and Loan executives that she was   concerned about financial markets' absorption with exchange   rate influences.       "I am concerned that we have gotten so nervous," about   exchange rates, Seger said.

acq	ARCO &lt;ARC> SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS   Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a   spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could   gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts   estimated.       Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on   rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on   about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was   valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.       Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement   around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of   the unit, leading investors to take profits.       After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,   closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.       "It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat   disappointing," said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He   said rumors of the spin-off had been around "for a couple of   days."       Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't   getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its   value was not reflected in the company's stock price.       Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said   the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and   he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.       Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says   chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about   three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500   to 600 mln dlrs.       Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake   because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the   company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.       But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall   through. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been   presented to its board.       The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion   dlrs.

veg-oil	DUTCH CONSUMERS/INDUSTRY SEE VEG OILS TAX THREAT   Dutch consumers and food processors   would be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats, Dick   de Bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fats   and oils, MVO, said at the annual meeting.       The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine and   fourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC.       The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers and   steeply increase the costs of industries such as potato   processing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said.       "A move by these industries to countries outside the EC   cannot be ruled out," he added.       De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats   would be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugely   expensive administratively.       He also said the proposed tax contravened not only article   three of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the   Lome Convention, and the United Nations Food and Agriculture   Organization (FAO) guidelines, but also the EC's own Treaty.       The proposed tax would not only be inflationary but also   have consequences for employment and investment, he added.

veg-oil	EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX   A spokesman for the European   Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy   on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help   alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.       Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's   Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils   and Fats Contact Days "the Commission firmly believes that the   sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in   the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to   make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem   within that sector by paying a levy."       The proposed tax is necessary because the level of   budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds   production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.       Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European   Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0   billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's "standstill"   agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then   feel the full impact of its enlargement.       The Commission has proposed several cost and production   cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum   guaranteed quantity system, he added.       Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer   prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700   Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe   said.       Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory   amount when market prices are below or above this level.       He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory   amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural   Policy's oils and fats regime.       "The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the   proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete   or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal," he said.       Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General   Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.       It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied   to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed   it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.       EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do   under present aid arrangements, he said.       The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC   produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities   imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,   Tanghe said.       The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'   requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall   effect would stabilise Community production levels without   affecting demand, he said.       It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current   import levels, he said.       Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are   imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals   requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.   Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported   beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

crude	U.K. COURT RULES AGAINST RTZ ON OIL FIELD COSTS   The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal   by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's &lt;RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit   and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the   future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,   the Press Association reported.       The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax   Commissioners that any such provision was a capital   expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.   The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an   annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of   abandoning a rig.       An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the   subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible   from corporation tax payable.       It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all   budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he   said.       Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was   shared by the industry as a whole.       The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the   expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the   expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were   built into the accounts, one analyst added.

Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected   to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier   levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.       The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes   above this season's available amount, Mielke said.       The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will   slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area   expansion in Indonesia, he said.       He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian   mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and   at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.       Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,   where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,   but where yields are lower, he said.        The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also   expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,   cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and   palm.       At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were   unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current   season's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago   and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.       Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start   of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by   the end of next season.       The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last   October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at   the end of next season, Mielke said.       World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the   course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in   soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln   tonnes or by one fifth.       Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,   for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln   tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks   of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this   season.

reserves:trade	ECUADOR HAS TRADE SURPLUS IN FIRST FOUR MONTHS   Ecuador posted a trade surplus of 10.6 mln   dlrs in the first four months of 1987 compared with a surplus   of 271.7 mln in the same period in 1986, the central bank of   Ecuador said in its latest monthly report.       Ecuador suspended sales of crude oil, its principal export   product, in March after an earthquake destroyed part of its   oil-producing infrastructure.       Exports in the first four months of 1987 were around 639   mln dlrs and imports 628.3 mln, compared with 771 mln and 500   mln respectively in the same period last year.       Exports of crude and products in the first four months were   around 256.1 mln dlrs, compared with 403.3 mln in the same   period in 1986. The central bank said that between January and   May Ecuador sold 16.1 mln barrels of crude and 2.3 mln barrels   of products, compared with 32 mln and 2.7 mln respectively in   the same period last year.       Ecuador's international reserves at the end of May were   around 120.9 mln dlrs, compared with 118.6 mln at the end of   April and 141.3 mln at the end of May 1986, the central bank   said. gold reserves were 165.7 mln dlrs at the end of May   compared with 124.3 mln at the end of April.

trade	EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CRITICISES U.S TRADE MEASURES   The European Community (EC) accused the   United States of violating a political commitment to free trade   through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a   customs user fee.       EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the   surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade   (GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.       Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in   criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which   import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to   improve its balance of payments.       The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules   by restricting imports of agricultural products through an   import licensing system. The United States asked for   consultations with Tokyo on the issue.       Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a   political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,   pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.       When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to   negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT   surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT   jargon as "standstill and rollback."       Tran criticised Washington for the "superfund" tax on oil   imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special   machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government   procurement list for reasons of national security.       Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the   policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.       The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks   to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,   to decide any further action on the charges.       The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the   subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the   Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.       The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's   report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports   breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its   legislation.       Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,   brought the dispute to the GATT last year.

copper	ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT   Zambia's copper mining industry is hoping   to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a   year in the next few years despite low world prices,   deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry   officials said.       But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough   International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has   introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure   the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.       Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia   Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year   ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a   record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.       "We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial   year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due   to greater availability of spares and equipment," a ZCCM   official said.       ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another   strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.       Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes   higher than the previous year and the best production achieved   to date.       Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper   industry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining   is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the   country's foreign exchange earnings.       Production has also been seriously affected in recent years   by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of   spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output   last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.       A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984   by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African   Development Bank and the World Bank.       The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and   metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.       ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has   said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as   part of the plan.       More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the   industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under   the five-year restructuring plan.       Company officials said although reserves were being   depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the   end of the century, though at lower levels of production.       Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for   the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln   kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being   levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.       ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared   with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.       Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in   1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as   the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over   two to the dollar.       But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the   auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,   and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic   strategy based on national resources.       ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the   break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.       "We are still consulting to see how the new measures will   affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare   under the new situation," Peter Hansen, director of operations   and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.       Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange   rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export   profits.       "Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even   point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar," Frederick   Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.       High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian   industry.       Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69   cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States   and under 40 cents in Chile.       The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia   being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had   stopped sBending copper south through South Africa.       Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are   sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while   5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.   Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and   fuel.

fuel	TANZANIA RAISES FUEL PRICES,TAXES IN 1987/8 BUDGET   The Tanzanian government, in its   second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery   program inspired by the International Monetary Fund, announced   increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on   government services.       Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected   to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8,   39 pct more than this year's estimate. Revenue would provide   48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to   be financed through domestic and foreign loans.       This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only   3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to   impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. No   figure for the final deficit was avaialble.       The budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with   effect from July 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30   pct.       Msuya said regular petrol would go up 52 pct, with similar   increases in the cost of premium and kerosene. Diesel would   rise by 75 pct.       The higher levies affect official transactions such as road   tolls, vehicle transfers and various licence fees, he added.

trade	U.S. SAID UNFAIRLY PROTECTING DEFENSE INDUSTRY   Britain's Defence Minister George Younger   said the U.S. Was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and   this could lead to British firms demanding counter-measures.       Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S.   Legislators were failing to realise "the true nature of the   two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment.       A British parliamentary report said that up to March   British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of   contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with   the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.       The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and   "selectiveness" towards foreign contractors had denied British   competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them   from technological research for SDI.       Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts   under conditions of fair and open competition. "All we ask is   for our companies to be given similar opportunities," he added.       If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair   subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be   surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures,   Younger said.

cotton	WEST TEXAS COTTON CROP UNSCATHED BY STORM   The West Texas cotton crop was largely   unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night   that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts   said.       "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly   nothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extension   agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West   Texas.       Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New   York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.      Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95   cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25   cents.       "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and   when that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, a   senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.       Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which   produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.       The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricane   force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the   West Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.       "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July   or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been   worse," Mohler said.       About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been   planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if   weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.       The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about   95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier   than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.

platinum	S. AFRICAN UNION OBJECTS TO PLANNED MATTHEY MOVE   A South African trade union is in   dispute with a subsidiary of Britain's Johnson Matthey Plc over   the company's proposal to move a platinum refinery near   Johannesburg to a black tribal homeland.       The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers Industrial   Union said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswana   homeland, where South African unions are not recognised, could   lead to job losses and affect wages.       A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum Holdings   Ltd &lt;IPLA.J> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinum   prices rocketing.          The union said talks with management over the proposed move   had broken down. It said an earlier ballot of refinery workers   showed that most favoured striking over the move but added that   no final decision had been taken on strike action.       The refinery processes all platinum metals of Rustenburg   Platinum Holdings Ltd, the world's largest platinum producer.       It is owned by Matthey Rustenburg Ltd, a joint-subsidiary   of Johnson Matthey and Rustenburg which, in turn, is owned by   mining group Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co Ltd.

grain:wheat	EC INCREASES SPECIAL FEED WHEAT TENDERS - TRADE   The European Community (EC) has increased   the size of two special export tenders for British and West   German feed wheat held in intervention stores and included   South Korea as an acceptable destination, traders said.       The tender was originally for 120,000 tonnes of British and   120,000 tonnes of West German feed wheat for shipment only to   Poland.

fuel	TANZANIA RAISES FUEL PRICES, TAXES IN BUDGET   The Tanzanian government, in its   second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery   program inspired by the International Monetary Fund, announced   increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on   government services.       Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said regular petrol would go   up 52 pct, with similar increases in the cost of premium and   kerosene. Diesel would rise by 75 pct.       Msuya said the government expected to spend 77.33 billion   shillings in the financial year 1987/8, 39 pct more than this   year's estimate. Revenue would provide 48.84 billion shillings,   leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to be financed through   domestic and foreign loans.

gnp:housing:income	BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING   A trade-led boom in the U.S. is   unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will   merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and   other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its   latest economic report.       Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,   after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will   contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.       As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5   pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,   the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.       "Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop   dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause   a falloff in the growth of disposable income," Van Dyke said.       Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8   pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.       The report was released before the Commerce Department   reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,   after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal   consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with   a 0.6 pct increase the month before.       The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost   consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9   pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.       This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income    growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.       As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power   of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs   this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.       The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing   starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in   1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.       "For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988   or 1989 is more than a remote possibility," Van Dyke said.       Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an   improvement in trade. "However, with protectionist attitudes on   the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk," he   added.
nat-gas	BROOKLYN UNION&lt;BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE   Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas   utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of   Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to   transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.       Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the   United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or   non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot   supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,   analysts said.       Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing   pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South   closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has   relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.        In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs   per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas   costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.       Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open   access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear   of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.       Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for   gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.       Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of   supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a   Brooklyn Union official said.       Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said   most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through   to rate payers.       While net effect on the company will not be known for   several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,   end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,   will end up paying more for gas, he said.       Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas   demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be   small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin   Jenrette, said.       If the situation persists into winter heating season, high   cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.       Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for   spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,   Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost   factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with   end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering   firm, said.       "But these companies are not unwitting victims of the   take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers," he said.       Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request   for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility   for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.       Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will   threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to   alternative fuels, he said.       In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being   negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.       Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas   for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory   on the inventory charge, he said.       "Cool heads will prevail," DLJ's Launer said, " but it may   take a while."

Reynolds said work will commence on the potline restart in   the near future and it is expected that actual metal production   will begin on September one.       The company said the start up was necessitated by   continuing strong demand for aluminum and dwindling worldwide   inventories, and that the metal is needed to supply Reynolds'   various fabricating businesses.

tin	ITC CONTESTS USE OF DOCUMENTS AS COURT EVIDENCE   The International Tin Council, ITC,   intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the   presentation of internal Council documents as evidence.       The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against the   London Metal Exchange over its "ring out" of tin contracts in   1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which   the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer   stock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said.       The ITC's case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn   Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next   week. Court does not sit tomorrow.       In essence the Council is claiming that its status is   similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can   therefore not be used in an English court of law.       The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of   schedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow   when the European Community's legal advisers were due to   attend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various   legal actions today.       Otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal   administrative matters, delegates said.       The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after   June 30 following the two year extension of the sixth   International Tin Agreement.       As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the Council   will continue with its statistical work and carry out some   research studies, although staffing in the research department   is being cut to one from two previously.       At this week's session the Council elected Philip Sparkes   of Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members   and Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the   consumers for the year from July 1. Future quarterly sessions   are scheduled for October 5/7 and December 14/16.

acq	GILLETTE &lt;GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR   Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group   Inc &lt;REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette   Co that could draw some big international players and in the   process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts   said.       Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of   directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested   consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per   share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in   November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.       "I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and   more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands   to make a ton of money," said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson   Lehman Brothers Inc. "In play" is a term used on Wall Street to   describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling   takeover target.       Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon   gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through   November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per   share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of   three yesterday.       The agreement would be calculated on the basis of   Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a   split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other   company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262   mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen   returned telephone calls seeking comment.       "Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if   someone else takes over Gillette," said Analyst Deepak Raj of   Merrill Lynch and Co. "I'm not saying that is going to happen   but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45   dlrs per share."       Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons   why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring   Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon   private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two   years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's   operations. "He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of   the dearptment store business." Another reason is that Revlon   has recently made two other acquisitions.       Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if   some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble   Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.       Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for   Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,   RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston   Purina Co &lt;RAL>.       "Perelman is trying to put the company in play," said a   Wall Street arbitrageur. "He gets to share in the upside if the   company is sold." Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette   to resist Perelman's overture. "I can't see the board   consenting, what has changed between November and now," he   said.             Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.   "Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of   calculation," he said. But he added, "The Gillette board has to   be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by   shareholders." Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,   three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.       According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by   Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger   agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank   N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial   adviser.

The spokesman said the problems affecting sulphuric acid   and roaster plants that had halted production since May 4 had   been resolved.       However, he said production of zinc ingots this year was   expected to fall to around 86,000 tonnes this year at   Cajamarquilla, from 94,000 tonnes in 1986 because of the   stoppage.       The refinery has an optimum annual production capacity of   100,000 tonnes but its highest production was 96,000 tonnes of   refined zinc ingots in 1985, the spokesman said.

corn:grain	SENATOR DEFENDS U.S. MANDATORY FARM CONTROL BILL   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his   controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.   farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they   approve of the proposal.       The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per   bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for   soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on   planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs   for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.       Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market   sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting   nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the   first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings   examining farm programs.       Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his   "Family Farm Act."       -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income   and reduce government spending on agriculture.       -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not   ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would   increase overall revenue from exports.       This would be done by seeking agreement among major   exporting countries including the European Community on market   sharing at agreed high prices.       Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing   that such a grain export cartel is not workable.       -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports   would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices   stem more from "gouging" by food processing companies than from   high farm product prices.       Harkin cited what he termed "excessive" net returns on   equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct   Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.   Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct   Quaker Oats.       -- Harkin said a "legitimate" concern about his bill would   be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.       He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would   allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.   grain stocks for three years.       Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a   "predictable and stable" grain price, he said.       -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm   participation would be no more "mandatory" than the current   farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm   programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect   farm income.

"We are thinking about making an offer to Dome or Amoco   (Canada Petroleum Co Ltd) or the creditors," Blair told   reporters before the annual meeting. Amoco Canada is a unit of   Amoco Corp &lt;AN>, which has made a 5.2 billion-dlr acquisition   offer for Dome.       "There is ongoing, serious thought applied to Dome in Nova   and in Husky, but no decision of substance as to future action   has been taken in either company," Blair said.

He added that some of the discussions with other parties   about Dome included TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP>, but   refused to name the other participants.
bop:gnp	OECD SEES GERMAN GROWTH HIT BY LOW DOMESTIC DEMAND   West German economic growth will slow to   1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic   demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation   for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its   semi-annual review of the world economy.       This view is less favourable than the West German   government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this   year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic   institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.       The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,   with the gross national product rising by two pct in real   terms.       The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing   through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some   recovery in business confidence in the near future.       But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy   was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by   2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.       While noting that the government is bringing forward a five   billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that "the   medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy   could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow   relatively lower tax rates."       Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal   Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP   actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of   this year compared with the final three months of 1986.       Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared   likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of   the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.       West Germany's current account surplus, the target of   considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is   expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from   35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in   1988.

cpi:gnp:jobs	HIGHER GROWTH, UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE, OECD SAYS   France's growth rate is expected to   strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first   half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for   Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.       In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD   forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)   would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the   rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly   higher than in the first half of this year.       The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated   somewhat during the early months of 1987.        Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory   adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation   has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to   reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.       The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand   pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are   likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.       The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for   the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six   months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct   for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.

gnp:jobs	ITALIAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK LESS BRIGHT, OECD SAYS   Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988   is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly   lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade   deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and   Development (OECD) said.       But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a   slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last   year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing   economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.       The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,   but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.       The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five   pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in   import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour   costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report   said.       This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand   should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption   made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.       Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in   Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and   adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in   a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.
bop:gnp:trade	JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD   Japan's trade surplus is likely to   continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad   increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)   said.       In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the   OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last   year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while   export markets rose by only two pct.       But it said this differential between the growth of   domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,   "thus weakening the international adjustment process."       It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two   pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct   in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will   rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in   1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.       The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion   yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand   and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the   measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite   possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have   worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.       The OECD outlook said, "Continued large current account   surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial   net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure   on the yen." It said that further appreciation could then lead   manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus   weaken domestic growth.       The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to   gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct   growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance   on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a   0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.
trade	U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT   U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if   the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,   according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy   research groups.       The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute   of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross   border trade would benefit both countries.       But Cato chairman William Niskanen added "the two nations'   generally harmonious trade relations are probably not   sustainable without a new agreement."       The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade   totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding   talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers   remaining between their two countries.       The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both   sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining   remained.       Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties   could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on   President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and   this could hit some Canadian trade practices.       He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto   industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral   free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.       Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to   a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.   exports to Canada.       A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime   Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and   enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which   would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.       It would also increase the gross national products of both   countries.       Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all   tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules   for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government   procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.
cpi:gnp:jobs	ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN SLUGGISH IN BENELUX COUNTRIES   Economic growth will remain sluggish in   the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may   rise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development   forecast.       Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and   next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD   said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could   stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus   will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.       While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming   its borrowing requirement, "it will probably be insufficient to   check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit," the OECD said.       In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5   pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming   less competitive and imports rising. "Employment is forecast to   decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the   private sector and budgetary cuts," the report said.       Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987   and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining   domestic gas prices.       Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster   growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in   wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year.
gnp	SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH   Strong growth in domestic demand was a key   feature of the economies of southern European countries in   1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the   Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.       In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total   domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to   five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth   restrained private consumption.       Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and   domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected   to be halved to five pct next year.       In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,   had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross   Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption   were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain   strong.       The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply   next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European   Community and declining competitiveness.       In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards   following an increase early this year linked with the   introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due   to cold weather.
gnp	OECD SAYS HIGH WAGE DEALS HARMING NORDIC STATES   High wage settlements in Nordic countries   threaten to cut exports and reduce the international   competitiveness of their industries, the Organisation for   Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.       In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in   early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration   in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen   at risk from accelerating wages.       The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under   pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as   Norway, Sweden and Finland.       Overall economic growth will vary in the different   countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report   said.       After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic   demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one   pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a   slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross   Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in   Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark   and Norway.       Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic   strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained   and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.
bop:gnp:jobs	OECD URGES ACTION TO CUT U.S. BUDGET DEFICIT   The United States should take urgent   action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible   reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on   growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic   Cooperation and Development said.       The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,   said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress   quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit "could seriously   affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere."       It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,   running until September 30 this year, would substantially   overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion   dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.       "The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of   slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the   first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190   billion dollars," it said.       While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's   deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax   increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.       The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to   2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.       In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports   boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.       Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service   sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be   heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer   prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next   year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.       "Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors   behind the avoidance of recession," the report said.       The current account balance of payments deficit is expected   to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after   hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.       In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly   to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will   still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is   expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,   unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct   this year.       Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to   around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about   that level in 1988.

cpi:gnp:jobs	JOINT ACTION SAID VITAL TO BOOST WORLD GROWTH   Prospects for world economic growth remain   very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is   urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize   currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for   Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.       "The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,   and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments   imbalances are likely to persist," it said in one of its   gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.       The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of   western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only   2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's   2.5 pct growth rate.       "We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area   comfortably exceeding three pct," David Henderson, head of the   OECD's economics and statistics department, said.       The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising   inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,   Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world   debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic   downturn.       "At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth   remain favorable," it said, citing low inflation in most major   countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest   rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible   labor markets.       But private sector confidence had been undermined by   uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that "for   confidence to be restored, it is important for governments   swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments."       This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord   of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.       The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major   countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to   undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal   policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand   in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.       Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced   recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works   and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this   process, though it was too early to estimate its precise   impact.       He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic   demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.       The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has   worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast   to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct   increase in 1986.       There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the   unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the   average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last   year.       The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world   agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from   price guarantees and other measures linked to production   towards direct income support for farmers.

bop:cpi:gnp	AUSTRALIA SET TO GROW, BUT UNEMPLOYMENT MAY RISE   Australia's economy should manage modest   growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but   unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for   Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.       The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross   Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct   in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be   helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand   following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.       The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer   prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.       The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly   and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.       While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,   however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth   forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.       The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic   growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is   struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.       The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,   should again show growth over the next two years, rising by   0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.
acq	SQUIBB &lt;SQB> SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS   Robert Fildes, president and chief   executive of Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corp   is not interested in buying Cetus.       Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a   five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.       "This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major   majority holder in Cetus," Fildes told Reuters in an interview.   "Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they   want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind   of arrangement," said Fildes.       Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments   by Fildes.       Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only   one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK>   and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but   neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.       Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic   products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.       Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement    an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop   new biotechnology products in several fields.             As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'   anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.   Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but   not in North American and Western Europe.       "We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood   that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in   North America and Europe," said Fildes.       He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a   major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its   own in that market.             Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with   pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own   business. Many large corporations have invested in small   biotech firms.       But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made   in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus   because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship   with a large number of other biotechnology companies."             Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug   areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to "keep the   biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."       Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to   broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas   as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory   markets.       Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research   over the next five years.             "Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and   development to make it happen, while the equity position part   of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this   partnership," said Fildes.

gnp	FALL IN CANADIAN BUDGET DEFICIT TO SLOW   Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax   reform will not affect his determination to reign in   expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline   in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.       "Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,"   Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.       Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs   in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he   forecast in the February budget.       And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was   expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32   billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.       Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year   higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income   support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated   revenues.       But finance department documents show the pace of deficit   reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and   1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the   transition to the reformed taxation system.       The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in   fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1   billion dlrs in 1991.       Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian   economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct   this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an   actual 3.1 pct.       Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around   the current four pct level over the next two years.

He was responding to rumours in the New York currency   market overnight that the Ministry was reducing its pressure on   institutions to refrain from excessively speculative dollar   dealings.
dlr:money-fx:money-supply	FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY   New U.S. Banking data suggest the   Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path   and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists   said.       But they also said that if money supply growth remains   weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline   suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its   credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary   policy.       A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a   forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June   8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a   decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs   to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.       Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for   the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has   fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,   economists said.       "M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness," said Bill Sullivan   of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.       While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of   economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned   the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth   in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen   as better gauges of economic growth.       Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both   measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's   5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.       If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,   concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,   could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.       "Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open   market position? No," Sullivan said. "But does this mean the end   of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."       Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings   of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period   were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had   targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.       But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day   net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher   borrowings target would probably have been reached.       A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in   auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,   while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has   helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.       "If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed   easing at some point," he said.       Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little   attention to weak money supply growth. "It has been a number of   years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the   economy," one said. "I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is   falling apart and the Fed should ease."       Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a   prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary   policy.       They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates   for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and   higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke   off econmomic growth.       But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late   April. "The Fed has to determine if this represents a   fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives   them more room to ease," he said.

trade	SHULTZ WARNS ASEAN OF LOOMING TRADE PROBLEM   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz   warned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations   (ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the   U.S. For growth.       "Given the importance of exports, particularly export   manufactures, to all of your countries, you are going to have   to work hard to diversify your markets," he said.       "While you may be able to maintain your current market share   in the U.S., You clearly will not be able to look to the U.S.   To take major increases in your exports," he added.       Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei, Indonesia,   Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand the U.S.   Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many   now believed.       He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not   necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being   contemplated by Congress, "but simply because of the adjustments   the U.S. Economy will have to make in order to service our   large and growing external debt."       Shultz said the U.S. Deficit had resulted not from falling   exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth.
alum	INDONESIA RAISES STAKE IN ALUMINIUM PLANT   Indonesia has increased its share in a   434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from   25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhud   said.       The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised   its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,   capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen   in government loans to the company for an equity stake.       The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic   Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24   billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.       Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between   1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen   debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation   of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in   dollars.       Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to   about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if   prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.       Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a   year, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant,   situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan.
money-fx:reserves	TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY   Recent government moves to curb capital   inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's   foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar   against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.       Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the   reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two   weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the   U.S. Dollar.       Chang said, "The pace of increase in our reserves is much   slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable."   He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus   with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.   Dlrs a month between January and May.       The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and   West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.       On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of   local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank   purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90   pct of the value of a contract.       Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had   drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to   importers and exporters.       They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar   transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks   registering a fall of up to 30 pct.       Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against   the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese   cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five   to eight cents in May.       The bank dealers said the central bank, which had   previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1   billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial   demand.       They said they expected the government to keep the local   dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to   businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of   more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since   September 1985.       The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,   unchanged from yesterday.       Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,   "It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow   is quite successful."       Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower   rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from   Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.       Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed   imports of machinery and production equipment because of   exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate   would help boost imports, particularly from the United States.
alum	JAPAN APPROVES AID FOR INDONESIA, BRAZIL ALUMINIUM   Japan's cabinet approved a plan to help   financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and   Brazil, an official at the Ministry of International and Trade   Industry (MITI) said.       Japan will invest 24 billion yen in &lt;PT Indonesia Asahan   Aluminium> in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already invested   in the company. The government and private interests will   equally share the additional investment, he said.       They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in   new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in   Brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.       The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to   Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the   official said.       Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two   projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the   current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be   reached, industry sources said.       Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion   yen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32   billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia's   investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct.       The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an   additional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment now   totals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51   pct, the official said.       The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects   were larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan's desire to   help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to   stabilise sources of aluminium.       Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its   aluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, they   said.

acq	SAINSBURY'S TAKING CONTROL OF SHAW'S SUPERMARKETS   J Sainsbury Plc&lt;SNB.L> said it agreed to   take control of the U.S. Shaw's Supermarkets Inc through a   combination of share purchases and a tender offer at 30 dlrs a   share.       Sainsbury bought about 21 pct of the stock in 1983. It said   its U.S. Subsidiary, Chene Investments Inc, bought 2.55 mln   common shares from the controlling Davis family yesterday at 30   dlrs a share for 76.5 mln dlrs, lifting its stake to 49.4 pct.       A tender offer for the outstanding shares will be launched,   also at 30 dlrs a share for a maximum further cost of 184.4   mln.       The Shaw's Board and the Davis family has agreed to accept   the offer, thus assuring Sainsbury's a total holding of 74.0   pct.       The company had allotted 20.18 mln new ordinary shares to   &lt;Warburg Securities Ltd> which it said would be sufficient to   finance about 188 mln dlrs of the maximum 261 mln dlrs payable.       Shaw's operates a chain of 49 supermarkets in   Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire which in 1986 produced   sales of 1.1 billiob dlrs and pretax profit of 31.1 mln. At the   end of 1986 it had net assets of 88 mln dlrs.       Last September, Sainsbury's increased its stake in Shaw's   to 28.5 pct. In the year to March 21, it reported a rise in   pretax profit to 246.9 mln stg from 192.7 mln on sales that   increased to 4.04 billion from 3.58 billion.       Sainsbury shares had fallen five pence before the   announcement to 590p from last night's close but were unmoved   by news of the deal.

grain:ship	BANGLADESH NAVY UNLOADS GRAINS DURING PORT STRIKE   The navy is unloading   foodgrains at Chittagong port following a strike by nearly   1,000 dockworkers, Bangladesh Shipping Corp officials said.       The navy was unloading 74,000 tonnes of foodgrains from two   ships today, and four vessels laden with some 90,000 tonnes of   grains were waiting at the outer anchorage, port officials   said.       A spokesman for the workers said they would continue their   strike until authorities agree to their demands for higher pay   and other benefits. The strike began on June 11.       "Unloading of grains and other essential commodities started   normally after we called in navy personnel to help," a port   official told Reuters.       "The strike has caused no serious dislocation," he said.       The government meanwhile declared the port jobs an   "essential service" and said the strikers could be dismissed   unless they end the strike soon.

The cargo, priced at 249.10 U.S. Dlrs per tonne c and f   Taiwan, is set for delivery before July 7, he said.       The committee cancelled a tender for another cargo because   the prices offered by U.S. Suppliers were too high, he added.

Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should   receive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming due   to the strong yen and lower oil prices.       Agriculture Ministry sources said the producer rice price   paid to rice farmers would be cut after discussions by the Rice   Price Council, an advisory body to the ministry, on July 1 and   2. The consumer rice price is usually set in December.
bop:dlr:gnp:money-fx:yen	JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS   Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the   value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And   other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an   advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency   (EPA) said.       The advisory body said in its report that the yen would   soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global   basis were delayed.       An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to   slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to   restructure their economies.       The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut   Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national   product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change   would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually   during the seven-year period to 1993.       If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar   would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's   current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This   scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.       It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy   and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.
trade	JAPAN MUST TRY HARDER TO CUT SURPLUS - MINISTER   Japan must try harder to reduce its trade   surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure,   Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo.       He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut its   current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it   is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs. In the fiscal year   ended March 31 the surplus totalled 93.76 billion dlrs, or   about 4.5 pct of GNP.       The 6,000 billion yen economic stimulation package the   government unveiled late last month would help slash Japan's   current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs, he said.
tin	THAI SMELTER FACES TIN CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTAGE   Thailand's major tin exporter and   producer &lt;Thailand Smelting and Refining Co> (Thaisarco) said   it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of   insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines.       Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to   Thaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> unit, to less than   20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne   average, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters.       He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let   the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported   tin lapse on June 3.       The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct this   month from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lower   levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid   the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.       Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a   large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100   tonnes per day.       As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some   3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by   the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year   ending February 1988.       Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to   allocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.       The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however,   because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral   Resources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late   this month, Yoot said.       The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin   during January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.
crude	SRI LANKA PLANS TO RENEW ABU DHABI OIL CONTRACT   Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided   to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000   tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters.       They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is   now awaiting its approval.       CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31   this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1   at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in   the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three   parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.       CPC officials also said the company agreed with the   Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of   Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the   government selling price.       Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through   C.Itoh.       Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light   from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several   constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels   and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.       Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where   lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC   then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.       CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for   delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to   offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.       CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since   December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln   tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot   market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.

She said Evergreen had doubled its capital to eight billion   Taiwan dlrs since last August.       "The capital increase will boost our operations," she said.       She said Evergreen will use the funds raised from the stock   market to buy new ships and step up its global services.

Evergreen has placed newbuilding orders for three 3,428-teu   (twenty-foot equivalent unit) fully cellular container ships   with the state-owned &lt;China Shipbuilding Corp> for delivery in   late 1988.       Evergreen has a fleet of 66 container vessels, totalling   more than two mln dwt, the spokeswoman said.
bop:gnp	S. AFRICAN RESERVE BANK SAYS GROWTH RATE ON TARGET   South Africa recorded annualised   real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this   year and the economy should achieve the government's target of   three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.       The South African central bank said in its quarterly   bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January   to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the   nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement   in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.       It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the   third and fourth quarters of last year.       It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement   reached with international creditors in March as evidence of   improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.       The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most   repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term   foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.       South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised   surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of   7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus   of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth   consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.

gas	JAPAN FIRMS TO LAUNCH SALES OF 100 OCTANE GASOLINE   Japanese oil companies are starting   campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing   domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources   said.       Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this   summer, starting with &lt;Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.       Showa Shell Sekiyu KK &lt;SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell   98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.       Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a   higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted   other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.       "We have received a good response from consumers of Formula   Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel   consumption," Showa Shell said.       Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher   than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share   of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.       High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total   gasoline sales in Japan, it added.       Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct   of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately   after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.       Nippon Oil Co Ltd &lt;NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100   octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high   octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline   sales.       The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share   has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift   gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station   construction in the next two to three years.       "Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline   sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline   production quotas," an official at a major oil company said.       An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade   and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government   press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including   the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil   companies increase their international competitiveness.       Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil,   Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the   production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.       Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct   from the previous year, according to a MITI report.

Some cross-Channel ferry services from Ostend were   cancelled, the local news agency Belga said.       An Antwerp port authority spokesman said electricians came   out in support, reducing ship movements to a trickle. Unions   said Ghent and other major Belgian ports were also hit.       Few trains were running and some early morning flights by   Sabena, Belgian's national airline, were cancelled.
ship	CHINA RESUMES USSR SHIP REPAIRS AFTER 23 YEAR GAP   China has resumed repairs of Soviet ships   after a 23 year break caused by the ideological split between   the two countries.       The New China News Agency said an agreement to resume the   business was signed by the two sides on Wednesday in Shanghai,   where three Soviet commercial vessels were being repaired.       The China Daily said the first two Soviet ships to be   repaired in China since 1964 left the ports of Dalian and   Xingang last month.       Bi Yueran, managing director of China State Shipbuilding   Corp's ship repair department, told the newspaper the Soviet   Union lacked adequate repair facilities for the more than 600   ships deployed in the far east. Bi said China's yards offered   competitive prices, guaranteed quality and prompt delivery.
groundnut	TRACOMIN SEES LOWER U.S. EDIBLE GROUNDNUT EXPORTS   U.S. Exports of edible   groundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year to   September 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, trading   company Tracomin SA said.       It revised its December 1986 forecast that exports would   total 205,000 tonnes, citing low demand, the loss of U.S.   Market share in the two main importing countries, Britain and   the Netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at a   premium in the U.S. Domestic market.       Tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 crop   at 215,000 tonnes compared with 264,000 the previous year.       Tracomin said it expects a good 1987 U.S. Groundnut crop   and forecast a resurgence in U.S. Exports next year.       "Barring any market manipulations, a good U.S. Harvest in   1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and the   reappearance of the U.S.A as the world's leading producer of   peanuts," it said.       Overall exports from China, the leading exporter last year,   will remain at exceptionally high levels this year despite   quality complaints and difficulties in implementing some   earlier high-priced contracts. It is too early to say if China   can retain its current market share in 1988, Tracomin said.
crude:nat-gas	SAUDI OIL RESERVES RISE DESPITE HIGHER OUTPUT   Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi   Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according   to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.       Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167   billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,   while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft   from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.       Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about   200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi   Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per   day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.          Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as   OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture   their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed   from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the   organisation decided to cut production again from last   September onwards.       Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.       Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly   to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the   official Saudi Press Agency.       The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the   number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.          Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44   mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was   upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling   it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the   report said.       The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by   another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced   around 750,000 bpd last year.          Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from   998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began   operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes   per day, the report said.       Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4   billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.

It said total cost to Chrysler to buy all of the   outstanding stock would be about 367 mln dlrs.       Electrospace Systems designs, develops and installs   communications and electronic  systems and equipment for the   specialized needs of military and commercial customers   worldwide.       Chrysler said Electrospace will help its Gulfstream   operations grow in military and commercial aircraft sales.       But it said there are no plans to merge Gulfstream and   Electrospace. Rather, they will operate as "sister companies,"   it said.       Chrysler said its tender offer is expected to begin by June   25 and will be managed by First Boston Corp.       For the fiscal year ended April 3, 1987, Electrospace   Systems had earnings of 10 mln dlrs on sales of 191 mln dlrs.   The company employs 2,500 people. About 92 pct of its sales   were to the military.
crude	OPEC PRESIDENT LUKMAN EXPECTS SHORT, CALM MEETING   OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman   said he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to be   brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production   agreement may only need a slight review.       "I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,"   Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here   ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which   starts June 25.       "We already have an agreement which may need only a slight   review," Lukman said.       The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers   in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at   15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18   dlrs a barrel.       Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to   just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts   firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement   to keep the market stable.       "I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to   strengthen the gains we have made so far," Lukman said.       He declined to say if the current ceiling should be   maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and   18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.       "Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our   collective will to keep the market strong," he said.       He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks   ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this   was significant for its members.       Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year   when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a   restocking now for the winter was responsible for current   market strength.

corn:grain:rice	GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT   Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize   imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,   the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.       Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey   made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes   of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid   programme.       The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows   government concern over "lower than average rainfall in southern   Ghana and its implications for the major harvest."       Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing   areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of   Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all   major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.       GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences   of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought   experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to   alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.       The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously   affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts   of the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have   dried up.
interest	U.K. CENTRAL BANK WARNS OF EXCESSIVE RATE CUTS   Bank of England governor Robin   Leigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could   jeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K.       In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in   Birmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment are   more favourable, relative to those on financial assets, than   for a good number of years.       "It would surely be foolish to put that favourable   conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or   excessively," he said.       "We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at the   risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of   high inflation," he added.       Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would   argue that interest rates are still too high and deter   investment in industry.       "But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were   intervening to support sterling and had some temporary   difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in   base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at   the time," he added. Base rate is currently nine pct.
grain:wheat	FAILURE OF EC FARM PRICE TALKS DISRUPTS TENDERS   There will be no serious bids at European   Community open market tenders for wheat and barley until EC   farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, trade   sources said.       The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an   agreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export   subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the   uncertainty remains.       One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be   avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situation   will become more serious as time passes.       However, traders said there seem to be few buyers around,   lessening the disruptive impact of the delay.       Poland and South Korea, who are in the market for feed   wheat, will be offered intervention grain through special   tenders, traders said.

interest	U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES   More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers   fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes   the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other   interest rates.       And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in   years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers   trying to lock into cheap money.       The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials   said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home   mortgage business.       While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They   were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a   few years ago.       But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,   mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low   as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their   portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to   induce them to retain their accounts.       As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were   forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose   rates would move in line with the cost of funds.       "We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,"   said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,   explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only   offering variable rate mortgages.       The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped   homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders   concede they are being forced to undercut each other still   more.       Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier   this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by   National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for   new business, officials at all three institutions said.       The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even   below those on the variable rate loans.       "Of course they are less profitable than other (variable   rate) mortgages," said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which   earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate   new mortgage loans.       But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable   loans because, "It was just another way to attract people to our   mortgage product."       Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed   rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.       The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was   exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.       "Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage," she said, noting   that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct   of its 1986 volume.       In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they   offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest   rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the   lender is earning an above average return on assets.       But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won   the benefit of cheap money.       Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed   rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption   that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates   fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.       Young explained that the company had planned to protect   itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a   complicated hedging instrument.       But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations   and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He   said money market rates were too high to arrange both the   mortgages and hedge profitably.       However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does   make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This   means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond   and selling them to an investor.

ship	HIGH WATER EXTENDS RHINE RIVER BLOCKAGE   Rising water levels on the Rhine caused by   heavy rain are delaying an operation near Karlsruhe to raise   two sunken boats which have blocked the river's main navigation   channel since early last week, a Karlsruhe water authority   spokesman said.       He said two floating cranes were unable to begin lifting   the sunken tug Orinoko and its lighter because the water level   had reached 815 centimetres and was forecast to rise to 820-830   cm by tomorrow. He was unable to say when the operation might   begin.       Meanwhile, high water at Cologne has forced vessels to   travel at reduced speed, a water authority spokesman in Cologne   said. But a water authority spokesman in Duisburg, 60 kms north   of Cologne, said vessels there were moving normally.
interest:money-fx	FED EXPECTED TO ARRANGE SYSTEM REPURCHASES   The Federal Reserve is likely to add   temporary reserves to the banking system this morning by   executing system repurchase agreements, economists said.       The Fed faces a need to add a large volume of reserves this   statement period to offset a drain caused by rising Treasury   balances at the Fed after the June 15 tax date.       Most economists are predicting over-the-weekend system   repurchases. But some, who see a smaller adding requirement,   are forecasting a less aggressive combination of three- and   six-day repos. Fed funds were trading at 6-3/4 pct, close to   yesterday's 6.81 pct average.

heat	U.S. COURT UPHOLDS APEX DECISION FAVORING NYMEX   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the   Second Circuit upheld a lower court decision dismissing a suit   by Apex Oil Co against the New York Mercantile Exchange and   several oil companies.       The Court, however, ruled that Apex Oil could pursue   anititrust and commodities market manipulation allegations   against Belcher Oil Co, a unit of Coastal Corp &lt;CGP>.       Apex Oil, primarily a trading company, charged that several   companies, including Belcher, and NYMEX conspired to force it   to deliver heating oil it had sold on the mercantile exchange,   knowing Apex could not make full delivery.             The NYMEX ordered Apex to deliver four mln barrels of   heating oil sold via a February 1982 heating oil contract. Apex   eventually fulfilled this obligation but claimed damages.       Richard Wiener, attorney for Apex at Cadwalader Wickersham   and Taft, said the company has not yet decided whether to   pursue its case against Belcher Oil.       The NYMEX, meanwhile, has a counterclaim pending against   Apex Oil, seeking an unspecified amount of attorney's fees and   15 mln dlrs in punitive damages, according to a NYMEX   spokeswoman.

acq	HARCOURT &lt;HBJ> MUM ON REED &lt;REED.L> RUMORS   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc officials   were not available for comment on market rumors that it is   interested in acquiring Reed International plc &lt;REED.L>.       Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial   adviser, declined comment.       A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said   the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has   announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover   attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell."It's completely   inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they   drop the recapitalization," he said.       Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.       Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a   U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a   declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011   in light of the recapitalization.       Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon   Brothers Inc &lt;SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the   case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount   of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and   Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face   amount, Harcourt said.       Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange   Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the   court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,   they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.       Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not   required to issue common to debenture holders who did not   convert prior to June eight.       An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed   by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors   that Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in New   York said "there's no basis to think that it's us."

A spokesman for the governor said nothing will be decided   today, but said the governor will evaluate later whether to   call a special session in the next few days.      The governor's office said the possible action was triggered   by a proposal by Dayton-Hudson Corp &lt;DH>, which has been the   subject of takeover rumors. A spokesman for the governor said   the company proposed several amendments to Perpich designed to   make any takeover attempt in the state   more difficult.

sugar	COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN W. EUROPE   Cold and wet weather in northern,   western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet   growth but plant density is reported to be good in most   countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.       Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has   hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged   fields.       But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has   boosted sugar beet growth.       Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet   development, Licht said.       In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant   population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy   weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are   rated as slightly below normal.       In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with   heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.       In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it   was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which   continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work   impossible.       In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was   favourable for beet growth, Licht said.       In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring   beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.       In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,   it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was   generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.       In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall   boosted beet development.       Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes   between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to   delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where   beets are maturing very early this year.

A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), which   seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the   north to Lesotho in the south, said the governments would make   the first tariff cut next year.       In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff   reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete   elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000.       The PTA, set up in 1982, groups Burnudi, the Comoros,   Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda,   Somalia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.       PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between   members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker   states concerned about the effects on customs revenue.       The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely   traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the   organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items.

crude	U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING   U.S. crude oil prices are at their   highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC   meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any   policy changes from the session.       They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the   organization's accord in December, have risen on technical   factors within the market and concerns about supplies because   of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the   Gulf.       The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading   around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile   Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its   highest level since January 1986.       OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's   oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to   be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production   agreement may only need a slight review.       Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation   of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to   a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.       Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon   after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased   tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices   should begin easing.       "OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed   to in December because oil prices are firm," said John Hill, a   vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.       OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at   18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to   16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln   barrels in the fourth quarter.       This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising   from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.       Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,   Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a   reduction in output.       "And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to   trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that   OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price," said Nauman   Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.       But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such   as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.       "The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the   official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are   committed to stabilizing the market," said Rosario Ilacqua,   analyst with L.F. Rothschild.       However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting   in September to re-evaluate market conditions.       Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the   fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a   day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000   barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president   of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.       Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this   meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to   offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated   throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,   producers receive less money for their oil.       "The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,"   said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.       "In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to   produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act   as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two   dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting," he   said.       One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.       "The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian   Gulf," said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache   Securites.       Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been   regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration   is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the   U.S. flag, with naval escorts.       "Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis   like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that   could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up," Knuettel said.

crude	UNOCAL&lt;UCL> SCRAPS FLUIDIZED BED BOILER PROJECT   Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.   Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed   combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning   of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado   due to high costs.       Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic   Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at   the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been   eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports   from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract   from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.       Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized   bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,   compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.       The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and   electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.       Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment   tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project   uneconomical even with government price supports and loan   guarantees, Unocal said.       The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to   5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.

platinum	PLATINUM DEMAND ESTIMATED 17 PCT HIGHER BY 1991   Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln   ounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln   in 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson   Matthey Plc said.       Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation   in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in   consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest   single application for platinum.       Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,   Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released   in London today.       Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further   increase in investment buying and may well be cautious.       He said South Africa was the most likely source of   additional supplies and will need to increase output by about   500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.       The capital investment required to produce the additional   output would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political   climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.       The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the   1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,   Clark said.       "The very probability of a growth in demand set against the   massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion   only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to   conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially   underpinned in the medium to long-term," Clark said.

coffee	EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA   European coffee roasters and traders   have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating   International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee   Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.       Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee   Federation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.       The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and   would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an   unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current   coffee agreement, van Horick said.       If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the   ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new   agreement, van Horick said.       Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when   prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in   Brazil.       Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and   producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.       "Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the   formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal   leaves it very little to object to," van Horick said.       "The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not   reflect supply and demand reality," he said. "Our formula   builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost   everyone."       Although full implications of the new formula have still to   be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as   Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly   higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El   Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.       Because the proposal provides that future quota   distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it   should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing   so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.       "If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least   a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the   September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a   new quota formula, " van Horick said.       At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.       "Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If   there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two   months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might   just get an agreement," van Horick added.

While they may buy more American Physicians shares, the   Koethers also said they may decide to sell some or all of the   their stake in the company.

alum:palm-oil:tin:veg-oil	MALAYSIA TO RESEARCH TIN, WARY ON VEG OILS TAX   Malaysia is to urge fellow tin   producing countries to contribute more money towards research   into new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industries   minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview.       Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said he   had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive   committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC,   to draw up a paper on the matter.       Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans   Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.       He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals   for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be   defeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.       Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was   adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,   they would be compensated through access to the EC for   alternative exports.       "Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannot   see how this would work out in our case," Lim said.       Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250   mln dlrs a year.       The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC   meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.       "Not enough research and development effort has been put in   by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes   such as aluminium, paper and plastics," Lim said.       He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an   exciting possible new application.       Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money   which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the   new paper was produced.       He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental   barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International   Rubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accord   into some EC languages are still being awaited.       Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's   behalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said it   was important there should not be a long "interregnum" between   the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming   into force.       He described the present accord as a model for commodity   agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and   consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and   control over buffer stock management.

trade	LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS   A group of Latin American and   Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in   Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development   and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.       Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of   American States special committee on trade, said he was aware   of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added "the region should   not be the one affected by the trade bills."       He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar   and the budget deficit, and "it is regrettable to solve it by a   trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."       Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two   days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in   Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,   which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.       Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at   Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,   annual trade surpluses with the United States.       Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations   with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,   but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2   billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.       The European Community has also opposed the bills.       Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the   Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in   the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require   retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.       He told reporters the committee would likely mount a   campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate   on the Senate floor, expected next week.       Rodriguez said "the region needs trade to continue   development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively   by trade legislation."       Rodriguez said: "we need to keep the market opens -   especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign   exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue   national development progress."       President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he   termed "protectionist," and his aides now are mounting a effort   to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the   legislation.       Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez   said as yet "the administration is not in a veto frame of mind."
acq	REED INTL DENIES BID APPROACH   Reed International Plc &lt;REED.L> denied   rumours on the U.K. Stock market that it was the target of a   takeover bid and said it had received no approach.       "In view of the increase in our share price today, I want to   make clear that we have not received any bid approaches," Reed's   chairman Leslie Carpenter said in a statement.       Rumours that U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc   &lt;HBJ> might bid for Reed, a paper and printing company, pushed   Reed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they eased   back to 564p at the close against a background of a widespread   decline in U.K. Equity prices.       Share market analysts said speculators were buying the   stock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort   to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert   Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp &lt;BPCL.L>.       Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC to   take it over, analysts added.

coffee	COLOMBIA HELPFUL BUT COFFEE QUOTAS UNCERTAIN--U.S.   A U.S. government trade official   responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on   coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian   efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.       Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just   back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing   countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be   agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.       "There is one country which evidently still does not,"   Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has   been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.       Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook   for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September   International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.       He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical   discussions with Colombian officials.       While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the   Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,   Cardenas left a "positive letter," Rosenbaum said.       The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month   which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula   for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns   with the technical details of the Colombian plan.       Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment   on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by   European coffee roasters and traders.       Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick   said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving   averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for   the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.       The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas   unless "objective criteria" which reflect recent changes in the   coffee market are used to set export limits.
grain:meal-feed:rice	CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES TO EL SALVADOR REALLOCATED   The Commodity Credit Corporation   (CCC) has reallocated 1.3 mln dlrs in credit guarantees   originally granted to cover the sale of protein meals to El   Salvador so it may buy rice, the U.S. Agriculture Department   said.       The action reduces the guarantee line authorized for sales   of protein meals to 12.7 mln dlrs and creates a rice credit   guarantee line of 1.3 mln dlrs, the department said.       All sales under the credit guarantee lines must be   registered and exports completed by September 30, the   department said.
crude:pet-chem:propane	INTERNATIONAL LPG PRICES STEADY IN QUIET MARKET   International LPG prices were little   changed in the past week, barely affected by the excitement on   the advent of OPEC's mid-year meeting, traders and industry   sources said.       "If the OPEC decides to increase crude oil production," a   traders said, "LPG supplies will be up without corresponding   rise in demand."       Petrochemical buyers were sidelined, after their foray in   the market early in june, they said.       An industry meeting in Dublin this week also drew many   market participants away from the trading desk, they added.       Algeria has moved at least two cargoes of propane to the   U.S. Gulf, keeping Mediterranean prices steady, traders said.       In the Mideast Gulf, propane appeared easing slightly,   after a major U.S. oil company bought propane on formula which   netted back about 123 dlrs, cif Mideast Gulf, which was two   dlrs below Saudi Arabia's government selling price (gsp),   industry sources said.       Delivered propane to Japan was quoted at gsp plus 19 dlrs   and butane at gsp plus 25 dlrs, the traders said.
crude:ship	KUWAIT SEEN WANTING TO LEASE SOME U.S. TANKERS   The United States said Kuwait was   discussing plans to lease privately-owned U.S. tankers to   transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of   its own vessels under American flags.       State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the   disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United   States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement   with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in   the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan   administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its   plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.       The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian   attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic   waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw   the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.       "The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering   U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration," Oakley   said. She emphasized, however, that "if some charter arrangement   could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging   arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis."       In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy   escort in the Gulf, she said.         The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administrator   of the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approached   an American shipping company about the possibility of a   charter.       Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives   of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered   vessels flying the U.S. flag "would be protected," the newspaper   reported.       Concerning Saudi Arabia, Oakley said "we are moving forward   in our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and security   cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations."

A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman would not identify the buyer,   but Wall Street sources said Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA.O> was the   company interested in buying Dayton Hudson stock.       The Wall Street sources said the Dart Group is expected   soon to file a statement with the Securities and Exchange   Commission on its accumulation of Dayton Hudson stock.       According to the letter to company employess, Dayton Hudson   management has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover.   According to the letter, chairman Kenneth Macke expressed to   the group buying its stock the company's desire to remain   independent.       Dayton Hudson Thursday night met with Minnesota governor   Rudy Perpich, appealing for legislative help.       A spokesman for Governor Perpich earlier said the governor   is expected later today to recommend stiffening the state's   anti-takeover law to help the Minneopolis retailer defend   itself.       Minnesota House speaker designate said the legislators   would probably look at language similar to that contained in   Indiana and New York law. He said any amendment proposed would   probably be designed to thwart a company from dismantling a   company for its own profit.      "Obviously Dayton-Hudson people feel whatever statutes we   have would not protect them enough," Vanasek said.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,   the group, led by investors Lawrence Altschul and James   Apostolakis, said it cut its Zondervan stake to 157,500 shares,   or 3.8 pct of the total, from 246,500 shares, or 5.9 pct.       The group, which earlier this month said in an SEC filing   it wanted join with other groups to maximize share values, said   it sold 89,000 shares between June 9 and 15 for 1.5 mln dlrs.       The group had joined with the Moran group, which last year   assembled a combined 44 pct stake in Zondervan during its   unsuccessful takeover try.

acq	NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA   President Reagan's nominee as top   policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an   agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock   price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the   globalization of financial markets.       David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at   Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday   to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and   Exchange Commission.       If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed   John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record   six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.       The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its   investigators have probed into the most colossal insider   trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.       The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in   recent months as a growing number of well known traders and   prominent investment banking firms have been charged with   wrongdoing.       The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after   Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock   speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators   and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal   profits after being charged with insider trading.       But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new   phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by   computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in    securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have   combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented   volatility to some U.S. securities markets.       At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some   lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate   takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers   steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.       And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign   exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork   for an international securities marketplace in which trading   occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.       Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment   opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce   U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.       Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial   disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,   eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to   spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's   review of hostile corporate takeovers.       Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton   investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to   the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.       In line with the views of other top administration   officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover   battles over new federal regulations.       The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider   trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that   topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the   administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.       Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with   Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to   significantly alter the commission's current priorities.       The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them   lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that   figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the   agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.       The agency is one of the few in the government that   actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past   few years because of fees it charges public companies,   investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.       The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,   meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the   president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing   for policy differences alone.       By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same   political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request   each year instead of leaving this to the White House.       Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins   to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed   in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted   market manipulations by large investment firms.       The agency requires public companies and investment   vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on   their financial condition and to disclose changes in their   condition any time they issue new securities.       It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to   register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and   it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.       Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial   magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to   become the nation's 35th president.       Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served   from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in   1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's   first term and was Reagan's director of the Central   Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.
trade	U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES   The Administration asked Congress to   replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it   into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade   Representative Clayton Yeutter said.       The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more   accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when   the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.       Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is   called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet   the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they   should pay about the same rates of duties.       Yeutter said, "American exporters will find it far easier to   deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of   differing systems which they now face."       He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational   negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.       Yeutter said government and business moves are based on   data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve   knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.       He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under   the new system, with about half expected to join the system by   January 1988.

bop:trade	ITALY DEFICIT NOT DUE TO LIBERALIZATION-MINISTER   Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Mario   Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press,   said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be   attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign   securities.       Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's   overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's   2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree   abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign   securities purchases.      "The deficit can be better attributed to premature and   delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)   rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment," Sarcinelli   said in a statement.       Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by   the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said   it had been partly caused by "non-banking capital outflows."       "In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow   of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our   borders," said the newspaper.       But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to   say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase   deposits had affected Italy's balance of payments.

nat-gas	TENNECO &lt;TGT> TO TRANSPORT GAS ON OPEN ACCESS   Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas Pipeline   Co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport   natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy   Regulatory Commission, FERC.       In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport   company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also   transport its own gas to customers.       Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERC   guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the   regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for   gas it has bought but could not sell.       The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay   contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term   contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as   customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.       Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that   Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to   open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.       But Tenneco today said open access "is one of the steps   FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC   is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even   before all transitional problems are solved."       A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure   under the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure   for Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from   Louisiana and Texas up to New England.       "We remain convinced that the most critical transitional   issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by   FERC in the near future.       "A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the   industry's continued ability to provide its customers with   reliable natural gas," said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co   president R.C. Thomas.

lead:zinc	NO COMINCO STRIKE TALKS SCHEDULED   Cominco Ltd said no   talks were scheduled with striking workers at its Trail smelter   and Kimberley, British Columbia lead-zinc mine.       A company spokesman said the company and union met   informally Tuesday but talks did not constitute a formal   bargaining session. The last formal talks were on June 5.       The workers went on strike May 9 and production has been   shut down since then.       The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and   110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at   Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore in 1986, most for   processing at the Trail smelter.
gnp	U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS   The economy faces lackluster growth   and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement   in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.       Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness   in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further   hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.       "These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength   to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?" said Lyle   Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers   Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.       The Commerce Department said this week that the economy   grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but   a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.       Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending   rose a weak 0.1 per cent.       "Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --   are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, "   Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,   told Reuters.       Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow   because inflation is rising faster than real wages.       To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,   returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost   personal income and consumption, he says.       "I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to   keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,"   Gramley said.       Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters   that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the   result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last   and said the recovery was showing anemia.       Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, "The pace   of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into   monetary policy" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be   accommodative.       Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct   forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if   the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add   to the risk of a recession.       Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May   came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an   inventory overhang still exists.       He says the boost in production came from smaller   industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have   improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.       "They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in   economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a   recession," Mauro said.       In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl   Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the   trade deficit will continue to improve.       "Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and   into 1988 are still quite favorable," he said.       But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in   inflation.       Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers   Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5   to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after   a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.       The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil   and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.       "The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets   out of the bottle, it continues to persist," he said, adding he   would like the Fed to tighten credit.       A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the   dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says   a prominent international banker.       Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National   Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and   the mark will continue for years because the United States is   the world's largest debtor nation.       The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a   further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that   the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.   "It is very difficult to be optimistic," Gut said.
coffee	BRAZIL COULD EXPORT 19 MLN BAGS OF COFFEE -IBC   Brazil's coffee exports could amount to   19 mln bags this year, because of the excellent crop estimate   of 35.2 mln bags, an IBC spokesman said.       He said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln   bags mark, especially if the final harvest to be conducted in   October and November confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags.       He said the average limit of errors for the official crop   harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first   estimates officially published today.       He said the IBC agreed with a request by producers for the   Institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the   guarantee minimum price.

interest	UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES   The six basis point rise of the past   month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a   series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the   dollar holds firm.       "Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis   points over the last month, largely over indications that   inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing   U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms," Samuel Kahan, chief   financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government   Securities, said.       Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in   the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is   whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the   longer term.       Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has   become more important to the direction of debt futures than the   beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.       The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer   Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down   1.5 pct, respectively.       Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money   supply announced this week was "surprising, much larger than   expected," according to Kahan. "Unless quickly reversed," such   a trend "will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,"   Kahan said.       Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which   Kahan said have "slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board   annual targets," the consequences could be a hint of economic   weakness down the road, he said.       Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for   further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,   analysts said.       September T-bonds "are up almost six points since about May   18," Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September   bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93   in mid-June, Duggan said.       While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,   and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through   chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted   above the 93 level.       "The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken   out before this activity is anything other than a trading range   market," Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst   Brian Singer said.       The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.   currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.       "The critical variable remaining in the market is the value   of the dollar," Kahan said.       Additional influences next week will be possible   developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact   and size of the U.S. budget deficit, "although these will not   be in the forefront of the market early next week," Kahan said.       In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding   auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and   Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results   with little excitement. However, a successful auction could   prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market   psychology.

money-fx	VENEZUELA PROBES ALLEGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE FRAUD   Banking authorities and police are   investigating an alleged fraud by the second largest trading   house in the Caracas free foreign exchange market, Finance   Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters.       The Superintendency of Banks and the Technical and Judicial   Police have both begun probes of Cambio la Guiara, Azpurua said   on Friday night.       Police said the owners of the firm, Mario Muggia and his   brother Luigi Muggia, have left Venezuela.       Cambio la Guiara operated in part on the "parallel market" in   which traders buy and sell dollars among themselves.       The Venezuelan central bank on June 17 suspended the   licences of all 21 foreign exchange operators in the parallel   market, blaming their speculation for the constant rise in the   value of the U.S. Dollar here.       Juan Domingo Cordero, vice-president of the Caracas Stock   Exchange and the owner of a foreign exchange trading house,   said on Friday he had begun legal action against Cambio la   Guiara for issuing him four checks without funds for a total   amount of almost one mln dlrs.       The Cambio la Guiara exchange house had operated in   Venezuela for more than 20 years.

crude:fuel:naphtha	OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD   OPEC has shown itself to be in control   of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a   pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day   (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.       They said market respect for the cartel has increased since   it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output   to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.       "There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured   there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in   effect putting pressure on end-users," a European crude oil   trader said.       In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, "There's no reason to expect   a weak market from now on."       A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, "We   thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter   production so the market will react very bullishly."       Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a   slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark   crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.       August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at   around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still   below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.       Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu   Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak   positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders   said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.       They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to   stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.       They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected   and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter   requirements before October.       Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on   European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.       "There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production   by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high," said an   international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less   bullish, "For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on   how much they (OPEC members) cheat."       A Singapore trade source said, "There is enough cheating and   leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is   no need to worry about shortages."       Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,   after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish   factor to be considered.       Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as   possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market   cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.       Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in   thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates   quiet on minimal buying interest.       Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and   tight prompt supplies, dealers said.
crude	FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY   OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6   mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost   spot prices and enable the group to raise its official   reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current   18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.       "Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the   official price will be 20 dlrs in January," a Japanese refiner   said.       The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC   members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and   Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.       Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as   the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987   output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs   for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for   U.K. Brent, traders said.       They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into   the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate   (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.       "With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import   Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those   grades further," said a Japanese oil trader.       Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot   market has further upward potential in the short term, having   risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.       "You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that   basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today," said   one international oil trader in Tokyo.       "But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought   back up again pretty quickly," he added.       One oil industry analyst concurred, "There is no reason to   expect a weak market from now on." He said he expected OPEC to   raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.       Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly   in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and   the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to   maintain steady prices.       Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day   compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its   export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline   through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.       Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,   against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up   to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.       Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating   on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price   discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But   they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as   swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher   output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise   too high too fast.       Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln   barrels. "Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the   stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises   too much," an oil industry analyst said.

crude	SAUDI OIL COMPANY GETS NEW ACTING GOVERNOR   The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's   state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has   retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.       They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation   planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.       Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,   left in a major oil industry shake up last December.       The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the   post permanently.       The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki   Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry   sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil   market.       The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20   years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi   Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned   to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.       Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an   OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel   last December.       Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations   which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia   does business, the sources said.       The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's   job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who   earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of   Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister   Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the   University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi,   Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic   Port.

Non-OPEC Egypt has pledged to restrain output to support   OPEC's moves to boost oil prices.

acq	WILLIS FABER BIDS FOR STEWART WRIGHTSON   Willis Faber Plc &lt;WIFL.L> will make an   agreed 302.6 mln stg offer for fellow insurance broker &lt;Stewart   Wrightson Plc>, a joint statement said.       The offer would be on the basis of three Willis shares for   every two in Stewart, valuing each Stewart share at about   655.5p.       Willis already owns 2.05 mln shares, or 4.62 pct, and has   received acceptances from Stewart's directors for a further   247,469 shares.       Full acceptance of the offer would involve the issue of   66.2 mln new Willis shares, or 28.2 pct of the enlarged total.       The companies said the proposed merger would bring together   businesses that were largely complementary. Both believed the   combination would permit more effective competition throughout   the world and enahnce the service provided to clients.       Following the merger, the two companies saw significant   opportunities for growth in brokerage income and considerable   scope for improved operating efficiency.       Willis shares were suspended on Friday at 437p. When   trading restarted they dropped sharply to 393p.       Stewart Wrightson shares rose to 576p at 0835 gmt from a   suspension price of 499p.
crude	NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY   Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in   planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15   until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle   told Reuters.       "We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,"   he said. "The accord reached there means stability in the oil   market and we shall continue making our contribution."       The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would   probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle   said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and   would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.       OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of   16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and   retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord   based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.       OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and   it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter   ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth   quarter.       Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore   fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from   planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained   within its December accord on output and prices.       Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around   840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln   bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.       The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since   February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.       Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for   a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement   on the latest oil production cutbacks.       Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC   producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia   and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep   prices stable.       Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an   OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around   18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.       Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export   earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price   during the first half of 1986.       But firmer oil prices since then have brought some   stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade   deficit.        Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently   refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to   the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

"Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an   announcement effect, in which we would reassure the market of   the fact that we have not changed our policy stance," a senior   central bank official told Reuters.

The central bank was concerned about growing market   expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part   responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,   the officials said.       But money traders said the market generally shrugged off   the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far   below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month   CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid   was 3.75 pct, they said.       The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact   because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.       The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD   buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's   pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.       "We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip   any further," a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing   market expectation of higher rates will remain.       "If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay   above four pct for the time being," he said.
interest	BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 1,200 BILLION YEN IN BILLS   The Bank of Japan will tomorrow sell 1,200   billion yen in bills from its holdings to help absorb a   projected money market surplus of 2,100 billion, money market   traders said.       Of the total, 800 billion yen will yield 3.6004 pct on   sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in   34-day repurchase agreements maturing on August 3.       The other 200 billion yen will yield 3.6003 pct in 43-day   repurchase accords maturing on August 12.       The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.6503 pct in   50-day repurchase agreements maturing on August 19.       The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.5625 pct   one-month commercial bill discount rate today and 3.6250 pct on   two-month bills.       They attributed the projected surplus mainly to 1,900   billion yen of government tax allocations to local governments   and public bodies.

veg-oil	EC PRESIDENCY PREPARED TO DROP OILS AND FATS TAX   Belgium, current holder of the European   Community presidency, appears ready to drop a controversial   oils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm price   package, diplomats said.       In a discussion document prepared for today's summit   meeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called   "stabilising mechanism" be the subject of "further study and   consultation with the Community's main trading partners."       The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on   both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine   oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.       The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at   the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm price   talks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the   measure.       Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on   June 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are   supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser   extent, Spain.       Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats   said, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a   further six months was certain to survive any redrafting.

trade	BANGLADESH'S TRADE GAP TO WIDEN IN 1987/88   Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to   widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the   government relaxed restrictions on some imports including   luxury cars.       The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1   billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,   compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and   1.113 billion dlrs of imports.       Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes   were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost   foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery   and raw materials, to increase industrial production.       The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives   especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and   importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told   reporters.       Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy   covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion   dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the   government were not included in the policy, they added.       They said the country's total import bill (both commercial   and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in   the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.       The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars   and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the   economy.       Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for   its main export jute, "which will certainly affect our export   earnings" in the coming year.       Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln   in 1986/87, according official figures.       But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which   accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would   play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.
alum	CHINA ALUMINIUM VENTURE AIMS AT SOUTH KOREA   China and Australia's Victoria state   signed a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminium   processing plant in China that will export to South Korea,   Australian officials told journalists.       China has no official direct trade or government ties with   Seoul, while it maintains close links with North Korea.       China International Trust and Investment Corporation   (CITIC) would have 75 pct of the equity in &lt;Bohai Aluminium   Industries Ltd>, the company to build the rolling mill and   extrusion plant on the northeast China coast, they said.       It was China's largest joint venture so far, they said.       "A joint venture opens up the potential for penetrating   markets that would not otherwise be possible (for China),"   Victoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said.       An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue South   Korean markets. Indirect trade between China and Seoul is   growing but is not officially publicised.       Victoria's &lt;Aluvic Ltd>, on behalf of the state government,   will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which is   intended as a sister plant to Victoria's Portland aluminium   smelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in   Portland.       The China-based joint venture would process Portland   aluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic   Chinese market as well as for export, Jolly said.       The Australian side's investment was limited to about 22   mln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint key   managers, he said.       Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generated   by their participation would lead to further CITIC investment   in Victoria. The Chinese group enjoys a high level of   independence from Peking's central government and has extensive   overseas investments.
money-fx:nkr	NORWAY CENTRAL BANK SELLS CROWNS TO EASE PRESSURE   Norway's central bank sold crowns in the   open market in a bid to ease strong upward pressure on the   currency, which threatens to rise above set levels in a basket   of currencies, dealers said.       The central bank declined comment, but dealers noted the   bank had also intervened and sold small amounts of crowns on   Friday. The bank is committed to defending the crown at certain   levels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies.       "They've been in again this morning, selling piecemeal   whenever they think necessary," a senior dealer at an Oslo bank,   who declined to be identified, told Reuters.       The crown's index is currently around 109.60 in the basket   -- close to its upper limit of 109.50 which the central bank is   committed to defending.       A low index figure indicates a high value for the crown.   The limit at the other end of the scale is set at 114.50.       The crown has been bolstered by high Norwegian interest   rates, currently around 16 pct in the money market, and better   than expected economic indicators which showed a sharply   reduced foreign trade deficit in May and inflation stabilising   around the current annual rate of 10 pct.

The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an   unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and   dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy   taking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market.       The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidies   of around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week's   talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S.       U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has   returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline   for agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved a   related dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports.       The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be   reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was   also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC   pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.       But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a   few days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and Frans   Andriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10.

grain:oilseed:rapeseed:wheat	POLISH FARM PRICES AND COSTS TO RISE FROM JULY   Polish farmers will receive price rises   ranging from 13.4 pct for some crops to 23.3 pct for meat from   July 1, the Finance and Agriculture ministries said.       The state procurement price for rape will rise 13.4 pct to   5,500 zloties per quintal, while wheat and rye will go up an   average 18.2 pct to 3,100 and 2,400 zloties per quintal. Pork   will rise by 18.8 pct and beef 23.3 pct.       The ministries said the new prices aimed to ensure farmers'   profits and meet higher living costs. But at the same time they   said fertilisers would rise by an average 50 pct, animal feeds   by 38 pct and tractors by 25 pct.
veg-oil	EC FARM MINISTERS TO MEET TOMORROW AFTER SUMMIT   European Community agriculture   ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a   two-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attempt   to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission   spokesman said.       He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain   notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical   nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the   ministers reach an accord.       The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but   said they would not be the sort of "dynamic" moves which EC Farm   Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the   case of complete deadlock among farm ministers.       These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of   ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, EC   sources said.       Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices   by seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sources   said.       EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still   split over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and   marine oils and fats.       In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans for   cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency   system.       Earlier today, diplomats said Belgium, the current holder   of the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop the   plans for the controversial oils and fats tax.
hog:livestock:trade	CANADA THREATENS BAN ON DANISH PIGMEAT IMPORTS   Canada has threatened to stop imports   of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary   inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish   agriculture ministry official told Reuters.       The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the   request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached   for support.       Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an   interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: "Denmark will not   accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach   an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC."       Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns   in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community   totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.       Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion   that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC   veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.       But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said   the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC   regulations. "Canadian officials are very concerned about the   trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the   EC and bilaterally," she added.
crude	EXTRACTS FROM OPEC COMMUNIQUE   Following are extracts from the   communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference   here.       "The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive   results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which   OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18   dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings   distributed into national production levels.       "The conference noted that all market indicators, including   spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC   crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating   the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement."       "The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the   second half of the year and decided that in order to secure   continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the   fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third   quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into   the same national production levels as were defined by the   above-mentioned agreement for that quarter."       "Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a   committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price   evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices   in order to secure price stability around the opec price   structure.       "Should there be any significant change in market prices,   the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary   meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the   necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the   year, which would secure the desired market stability."       "The conference reiterated the necessity of member   countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December   1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,   levels.       "For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a   committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to   member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the   terms of the agreement."          "Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the   cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside   OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market   stability.       The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group   of five heads of delegation established by the 77th   (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to   undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.       "The conference observed the continued fall in the value of   the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied   and reported to the next meeting of the conference."          "The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary   general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next   ordinary meeting.       "The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil   al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year   from October 7, 1987.       "The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be   convened in Vienna on December 9, 1987."
interest	POEHL SPEAKS AGAINST GERMAN INTEREST RATE CUT   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said   West Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and   that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a   six-month lull.       Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest   rates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: "We would be   badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.       "This could, under certain circumstances, release new   inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to   higher interest rates," he added.          Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past   six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.       "But since April, statistics clearly show that the economy   finds itself on a course of growth," he said. "I expect this   development to continue in the coming months."       Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community   trade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.       "For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by   protectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts," he added. "This   includes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far   as possible. Protectionism is not found only in the U.S."
crude	KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR   OPEC output for the second half of 1987,   including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln   barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,   Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.       Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its   ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters   of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter   level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter   target.       Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC third   quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while   fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd"       Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production   levels would have on prices.       Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,   rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to   adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln   barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia   and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when   a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about   September.       Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War   enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369   mln in the second half.       Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from   the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has   been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. "We will   not discuss it. There will not be any change," he said.       Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended   Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems   to be adressed. "We are overdoing it in holding too short a   meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet," he said.       Ali said the problem of price differentials between the   prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly   at the meeting.          Ali said "The problem of differentials is a real one. I   would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem   has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced   relative to heavy crudes."       Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the   next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said   "If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do   the work of another minister."       Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.       OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread   of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.
crude	IRAQ REJECTS NEW OPEC OIL QUOTA   Iraq has rejected its new OPEC   production quota set in Vienna for the second half of this   year, the official Iraqi news agency INA reported.       It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, who   returned Sunday, as saying "Iraq will continue to adhere to its   position considering itself as not included in the agreement."          Last December, Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987   quota of 1.466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2.255   mln bpd quota set for Iran, its enemy in the nearly   seven-year-old Gulf war.       The accord reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna Saturday set   an output ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd for the group's 13 members   from July to December, raising Iraq's share to 1.54 mln bpd and   Iran's to 2.369 mln.

cocoa:coffee:cotton	IVORY COAST WEATHER NO PROBLEM FOR 1986/87 CROPS   Ivory Coast rainfall this season has   been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee   production has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily   Fraternite Matin reported.       The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry   conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.   Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if   there is good rainfall in coming weeks.       Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest   in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has   especially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin   said.       Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this   month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,   compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.       Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture   had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not   need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have   been affected in some regions, it added.       London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast   1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,   which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It described   early development of the new main crop as patchy.       The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year   forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast   due to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated   the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's   4.33 mln bag harvest.       Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee   crop as "normal."

Diplomatic sources said the dispute could provoke new trade   friction unless it was settled soon.       Washington is insisting that the EC comply with what it   regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT   and cut export subsidies which have allowed Italy to take an   increasing share of the U.S. pasta market.       The EC provides subsidies of about 16 cents a pound on   pasta exports. The spokeswoman said the talks foundered on the   question of how much the subsidy should be cut.

castor-oil:coffee:cotton:tea:trade	INDIA RELAXES RULES FOR EXPORT PROMOTION   The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,   announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use   foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual   export earnings for export promotion abroad.       The move is designed by the government to improve India's   trade deficit.       Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit   Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various   textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and   electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports   goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.       The scheme replaces current rules which allow different   amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a   minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.       RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will   qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional   spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value   of annual export earnings.       These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and   semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,   psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.       RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the   two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their   freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.       Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably   higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because   holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to   RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.

DataCard declared a dividend distribution of one preferred   stock purchase right on each outstanding share its common   stock. The dividend is designed to deter National Computer or   other potential suitors from preventing DataCard from   evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value,   DataCard said.             National Computer told Reuters June 22 it could make a bid   for DataCard. On June 25 DataCard filed suit in Hennepin County   District Court in Minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct   stake of its stock to National Computer.       In announcing the rights plan, DataCard said it "is not   designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the   objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of DataCard's   stockholders."       The rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after   an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial   ownership of 44 pct or more of DataCard's common stock.             Once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy   1/500th of a share of DataCard Series A junior participation   preferred Stock for 35 dlrs. Holders other than an acquirer   would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right   becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred   stock with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of   the rights.       The rights dividend distribution is payable July 9 to   shareholders of record July 9.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,   Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June   26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie   shareholders "regarding the affairs" of the company.       Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct   stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more   shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer.       Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson   Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it   would be provided with "certain information" about Crazy Eddie,   it told the SEC.       Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in   electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales,   proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie   on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the   possible participation of Crazy Eddie management.       Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet   with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future.       Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and   investment banker.       In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that   Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility   with the company, plus further declines in the price of its   stock, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn said they are   "continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to   their investment" in Crazy Eddie stock.       Depending on its evaluation of the company, including   actions by Crazy Eddie's board and any possible third party   bids for the company, Entertainment Marketing and its president   said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell   some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open   market, through private purchases or in connection with a   merger or tender offer.       According to the SEC filing, Entertainment Marketing and   Zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 Crazy Eddie   common shares between May 20 and June 17 at 7.42 dlrs to 7.93   dlrs a share, or a total of about 11.9 mln dlrs.
crude:ship	CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW   U.S. moves to increase its warships in   and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on   unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a   direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.       They said the American decision inevitably carries some   risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt   rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.       "As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the   Gulf could do serious damage," said one western diplomat.       Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks   on "soft targets" such as merchant shipping not protected by   American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.       The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil   tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated   by diplomats as low. However, "There is the threat that the   Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,   will go for softer targets," one diplomat said.       Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar   Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was   "moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us."       The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10   warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to   patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.       The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting   Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered   to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.       Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by   Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.       Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by   Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is   preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.       The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to   make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.       A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a   launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the   Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.       "But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti   territory would be a very serious escalation" likely moving   world opinion against Iran, remarked one.       Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying   out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.       Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted   last Friday "a river of blood" throughout the world in the event   of any U.S. strike against Iran.       Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused   of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable   capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.       Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that   most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to   pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential   trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.       Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or   other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern   Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern   Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.       Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but   were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.       Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with   thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.       "Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a   pretty good rain," Mohler said.       Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking   an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of   Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off   19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.       Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is   expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north   later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across   the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as   early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage   in early July, he said.

acq	FED ALLOWS CITICORP &lt;CCI>, SEARS &lt;S> THRIFT DEAL   The Federal Reserve Board said it   approved Citicorp's application to purchase through its   subsidiary, Citicorp Savings of Oakland, Calif., some assets   and assume some liabilities of Sears Savings Bank of Glendale,   Calif.       Citicorp Savings proposed to assume two billion dlrs in   deposits and other liabilities and to purchase 1.9 billion dlrs   in assets of 50 branch offices of Sears Savings.       The proposal involved less than one third of the assets and   liabilities of Sears Savings, owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co   &lt;S>.       The Fed said that it generally has determined there were   potentially adverse effects of allowing affiliations of banks   and savings and loan associations, although it has allowed bank   holding companies to acquire some failing thrifts.       It said Citicorp's proposal "properly may be viewed as the   permissible acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of S   and L branches rather than the acquisition of an S and L."       Citicorp Savings, the successor to the failed Fidelity   Savings and Loan Association, has assets of 4.9 billion dlrs   and operates 86 branches in California, mainly in the north.       Sears Savings has 6.6 billion in assets and 91 branches   predominantly in southern California.       The application, which was approved unanimously, will not   eliminate Sears Savings as a competitor, the Fed said.

acq	GROUP MAY SUPPORT CARDIS CORP &lt;CDS> BUYOUT   A group of companies controlled by   Brookehill Partners Inc told government authorities it may   support a buyout of Cardis Corp as a way to maximize the value   of the company's stock.       In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,    the group disclosed that it currently holds a 5.5 pct stake in   Cardis common stock, and said it "would likely support" an   acquisition of the company as a whole or in parts by another   party, terming such a move "the most likely means for the   company's shareholders to maximize the value of their   investment."       Although the group characterized its Cardis stock holdings   as principally for investment, it said it intends to contact   third parties who might be interested in an acquisition of   Cardis, a Los Angeles-based auto parts distributor.       The group added its has already had "some contacts" with   others concerning the company, but said no understandings have   been reached.       "The (Cardis) common shares continue to offer opportunity   for price appreciation on the basis of the company's asset   value and earnings momentum," the Brookehill group told the   SEC.       The group, which currently holds 318,900 Cardis common   shares, consists of New York-based Brookehill Partners and its   two subsidiaries, Brookehill Equities Inc, a brokerage, and   Moore, Grossman and deRose Inc, an investment advisor. Walter   Grossmman, S. Edward Moore and Robert deRose, all of New York,   each own one-third interests in Brookehill Partners.       Since April 27, members of the Brookehill group made net   purchases of 6,000 Cardis common shares at approximately 4 dlrs   a share. The group told the SEC it may continue to purchase   additional Cardis stock, but also reserved the right to sell   its shares in the company.

acq	SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES   The Securities and Exchange   Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly   disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a   takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.       In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its   legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the   agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping   center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's   takeover offer.       Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs   on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.       On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had   urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a   share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping   centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.       Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads   the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of   Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC   filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in   sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.       Securities law requires takeover target companies to   promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.       The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct   of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a   share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed   by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at   thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.       Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an   amended SEC filing, the agency charged.       Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was   made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct   3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint   said.       DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for   control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October   when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or   48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes   after it dropped its hostile tender offer.       The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal   judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in   Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.       The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining   with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal   tender offer.       But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was   dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.       In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,   the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply   with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.       Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it   became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and   quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.

It described the purchaser as a subsidiary of a company in   the communications field which is one of the 100 largest U.S.   corporations.

It said a 31.5 mln dlr 14 pct note is payable in four equal   instalments over four years.

interest	U.S. TO END NETHERLANDS ANTILLES TAX TREATY   The Treasury Department said it   notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948   income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and   Aruba.       The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury   said in a two-sentence announcement.       The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations   between the United States and the Netherlands over the past   eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman   said.       The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of   Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no   longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the   spokesman said.       Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles    may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have   maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the   spokesman said.       He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an   adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general   decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance   at lower interest rates.       However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced   with lower yields.

copper	CIPEC STUDYING COPPER MARKET BACKWARDATION   The Paris-based Intergovernmental Council   of Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) is closely studying the   current backwardation in world copper market prices but does   not envisage taking corrective action at present, CIPEC sources   here said.       The organisation's executive and marketing committees   reviewed the current market situation during a series of   meetings here late last week, but took no major decisions.       The sources noted that the backwardation - premium of   nearby supply over forward delivery - dates back several weeks   and is the longest on record.      "It's unusual," one official said, but added CIPEC did not   have any immediate recipe to remedy the situation.       The meetings featured a gathering of the 10 directors of   CIPEC's regional copper development and promotion centres,   which are based in Europe, Japan, India and Brazil.       Their main aim was to prepare the ground for the annual   ministerial meeting of CIPEC, which is scheduled for Zaire in   late September.

The main consumer country the United States and main   producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution   when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in   February.       Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in   September will be to support the world coffee pact, defend its   market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the   hands of producer countries.       "We have sacrificed a great deal already," he said. "this year   we have a crop of 35 mln bags, we have economic problems and we   are not in a position to do favours."

acq	SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING   Corporate mergers and acquisitions   in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had   only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a   leading business-backed organization said.       The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business   firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a   nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered   some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding   communities had not.       Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left   due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but   another 21 firms were added to the list.       Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.   During the period, only six located in the city achieved   Fortune 500 status.       Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of   McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study   grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously   hurt the economic climate of northern California.       However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been   lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were   created during the period.       At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater   rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest   of the United States and California.       Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and   chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news   conference that the region had difficulties in persuading   companies to locate there because of a fragmented local   political system.       But he said that because of the amenities of living in San   Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other   metropolitan area.       "It's a great place to run a business," he added, "but it's   a hell of a place to do business with government."       The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf   Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the   restructuring activity.       Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period   were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;   Cooke and Rolm.       Companies that grew enough during the period to make the   Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,   McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.       The study by the management consulting firm said that,   partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth   in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.       In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership   had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and   charitable activities.

crude	CHEVRON N.SEA FIND MAY HOLD 300 MLN BBLS -ANALYSTS   A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron   Corp's &lt;CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a   new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln   barrels, industry analysts said.       Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.   Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API   crude oil from the tertiary "Alba" sand through a three-inch   surface choke.       "The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320   mln barrels," Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson   and Co told Reuters.       He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the   field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of   oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25   pct.       Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the   potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the   field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be   plugged and a sidetrack drilled.       "The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will   require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs   up," Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.       Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil   found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well   showed that it flows well.       "Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,   it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be   recovered," Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.       However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the   analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further   research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not   disclose any reserve figures.       Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial   and developed, there would be a ready local market for the   heavy crude it produced.       "Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and   the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a   lot narrower today," Osborne said.       Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which   include British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons   (UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet. (GB) Ltd   and Phillips Petroleum Co U.K. Ltd.

cotton:grain:rice	PAKISTAN ALLOWS PRIVATE COTTON, RICE EXPORTS   The Pakistani government allowed the   private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy   announced to cover the next three years.       Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a   televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import   of cotton yarn.       Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have   been handled exclusively by state corporations since early   1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and   rice along with the state corporations.       He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make   high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and   to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This   would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.

crude	ECUADOR TO PRODUCE ABOVE OPEC QUOTA - MINISTER   Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess   of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this   year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news   conference.       Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to   320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.       "We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the   crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and   Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to   produce during the past few months," he said.       Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean   production from March to May this year.       Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC   members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase   in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.       "They understood our position and we believe we remain   within the spirit of the (quota) agreement," he said.       Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production   was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.       While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and   Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four   mln barrels of products, Santos said.

veg-oil	FRANCO-GERMAN PARLEY FAILS TO UNBLOCK FARM TALKS   A specially convened Franco-German   meeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to   make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has   deeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said       The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign   ministers from both countries and by French President Francois   Mitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by Chancellor   Helmut Kohl of West Germany.       The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to   providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the   Community's worst-ever budget crisis.       "The Germans clearly do not want to budge," an aide to Chirac   told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly   angered as he the hour-long meeting.       Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for   the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the   EC's complex "green" currrency system, designed to translate   common EC farm prices into national currencies.       Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which   West Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and the   Netherlands.       EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the   package, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline   tomorrow.       Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have   injected fresh impetus into those talks.       The Commission proposed its package to save one billion   dollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget.       The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to   alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and   plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987.
crude:money-fx	VENEZUELA LOWERS EXCHANGE RATE FOR OIL EARNINGS   Venezuela's cabinet approved a new   exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at   14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,   Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.       Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the   measure is "fundamental to conserving the economic and financial   strength of the petroleum industry."        He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the   central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state   oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its   problem of working capital and implement investment plans,   estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when   the measure would become effective.      Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings   to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign   exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.      The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic   goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that   it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more   government debt bonds.                               PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at   the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust   fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in   government bonds.     According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,   the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by   repurchasing the bonds.       PDVSA's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480   billion bolivars. It foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial   sales were 8.023 billion dlrs.

housing:interest	INTEREST RATES HURT U.S. MAY HOUSING SALES   Sales of new single-family homes   tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher   mortgage interest rates, analysts said.       "There should be another month or two of very weak new home   sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes   should become more stable by mid-summer," said economist   Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.       The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of   616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce   Department said.       Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at   about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,   according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.       The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out   of the market, he and others said.       "The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly   unexpected by homebuyers," said Cynthia Latta, an economist   with Data Resources. "They were so startled, they wanted to   hold back and see what would happen."       The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was   sharper than expected, some economists said. "We fully expected   a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated," said   James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings   Institutions.       Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of   existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new   homes.       Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new   condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were   reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.       Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,   "Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market   is going to stabilize and give us a good second half."       Others were less optimistic, however.       "We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I   don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family   housing," said Chimerine of Wharton.       Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan   Bank of New York, said, "The lower sales level will be   maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.   There won't be much specific improvement in coming months."

ship	U.S. REASSERTS PLANS FOR DETERRENT ROLE IN GULF   The United States responded to an   apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued   assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would   play purely a deterrent role.       "I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that   we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and   that that shipping is not related to the war itself," State   Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.       He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States   was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.       Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi   Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,   "At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of   an armed encounter with us.       "We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.   Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We   are determined to stand firm and will certainly win."       The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its   Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the   refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the   strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.       The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil   tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag   and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.       Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman   Marlin Fitzwater said, "We won't have any comment or response to   the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about   the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war   with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements   that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not   helpful or welcome."       Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that   Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.

Kellogg Co   subsidiary said it in consortium with &lt;Inelectra> received a   contract from Corpoven S.A., a Venezuelan-owned domestic oil   company, to revamp and expand its El Palito Refinery.       Kellogg said the installed cost of the work to be performed   is estimated to be 130 mln dlrs. Inelectra, Kellogg said, is a   major Venezuelan engineering firm.      Kellog said the project will enable the refinery to produce   BTX products -- benzene, toluene, and orthoxylene -- by   processing naphtha feed from an expanded reformer-hydrotreater.       Kellogg said the refinery's reformer-hydrotreater will be   upgraded to 9,500 barrels a day capacity from 7,500.       It said the new BTX process units include aromatic   extraction, xylene fractionation, xylene isomerization and   thermal hydrodealkylation.       Kellogg pointed out that Venezuela now imports all of its   BTX aromatics.

trade	ISRAEL MINISTER SEES INCREASED EXPORTS TO U.S.   Israel's exports to the U.S. can and   must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's   goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad   Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.       Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce   seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.   were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total   exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion   dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.       "I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach   five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to   function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis   on product quality," Yaacobi said.       While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European   currencies is a "bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,"   Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend   toward higher U.S. exports.       In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose   fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while   imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.       Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct   annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.        He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed   last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial   restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would   continue to facilitate the desired export growth.       Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as   an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.   firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage   of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.       Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle   east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able   to achieve its economic potential.       Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in   aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing   military conflicts "which were imposed on Israel," he said.       Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,   Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic   independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that   exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

crude	VENEZUELA BUDGET SEES 16.35 DLRS OIL PRICE   Venezuela's government tomorrow presents   a 1988 budget proposal for 183.432 billion bolivars, based upon   an oil price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel, finance minister Manuel   Azpurua said.       Azpurua told reporters after a cabinet meeting the new   budget projects ordinary income of 149.925 billion bolivars and   extraordinary income of 34.186 billion. Oil revenues are   expected to produce 92.014 billion, or 61 pct of the total.       The finance minister said the oil revenue projection is   based on an average price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel in 1988.   Venezuelan oil through the first half of 1987 has averaged 16.   20 dlrs per barrel, according to the state oil company   Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A.
acq	GENCORP &lt;GY> TO SELL GENERAL TIRE   Gencorp Inc and Continental AG of   Hanover, West Germany, jointy announced they signed an   agreement for Continental to buy Gencorp's General Tire Inc   subsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash.       Under the agreement the companies said Continental will   acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and   foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the   medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired   on or before November 30, 1984.       The sale is expected to be completed on or before November   one and is subject to meeting certain conditions.       Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last   year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9   billion dlrs generated by its tire operations.       Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln   dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating   profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.       GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain   about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire   employees under the agreement.       Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to   reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.       In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a   partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and   Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase   of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs   a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs       As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned   to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO   General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast   properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive   components businesses.             Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs   in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of   several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,   including general tire.       "The price paid for General tire would not cause us to   reevaluate that estimate," said Tilden.       General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four   tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.       In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said   the sale of General Tire "represents a critical accomplishment   in our plan to restructure GenCorp."             Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of   its other businesses are "proceeding satisfactorily."       Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold   are its RKO bottling operations. GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's   KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for   217 mln dlrs. That deal awaits approval by the Federal   Communications Commission. GenCorp also received 257 dlrs after   tax from the sale of RKO's WOR-TV.

At the request of the board, Rorer has agreed to extend   until 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from A.H.   Robins.       After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last   Thursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds   control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger.       But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge   independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be   thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as   a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon   Shield related liabilities.       After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's   latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln   dlrs.       Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated   1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320,000   claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the   Dalkon Shield interuterine device.
cotton:grain:rice:trade	PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS   Pakistani government allowed freer   cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed   at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.       Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a   televised speech the government had also decided to allow   duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry   more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of   Pakistani products.             Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have   been handled exclusively by state corporations since early   1970s.       But Haq said now the private sector would also export   cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a   long-standing demand of the local traders.       The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to   bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries   compete effectively in the world market, he said.             Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year   1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but   reviewed every year.       It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing   trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would   enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a   longer period.       He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided   for the export of engineering goods to selected third world   countries on soft credit terms.             Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per   cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23   billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.       He said the government policy was to rationalise and   streamline import controls.       "It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,   specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local   industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," he   said. "Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods   produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise   to smuggling and hampering of exports."             He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed   from import restrictions.       Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from   remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the   Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the   drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a   balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.
acq	CITICORP &lt;CCI> SAVINGS EXTENDS CALIFORNIA REACH   Citicorp has extended its reach   into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition   of 50 of Sears Roebuck's &lt;S> Sears Savings Bank branches,   bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,   CitiCorp Savings said.       Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the   Federal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and shows   its serious intent to penetrate the California market.       The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into   Southern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.   Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California.       "This marks our first major expansion in California,   particularly in the south," said Citicorp Savings President   Edward Valencia, in a statement.       Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major   near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but   do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than   Sears was in that market.       "We do believe they will be a better competitor than   Sears," said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home   Federal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD>, based in San Diego.       Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as   groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California   market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to   operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to   convert the branches to banks at that time.       In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion   dlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in   the thrift market, against such large California thrifts as   Home Federal, Great Western Financial Corp &lt;GWF>, H F Ahmanson   and Co &lt;AHM>, Golden West  Financial &lt;GWD> and Great American   First Savings Bank &lt;GTA>.

Analysts also said Contel's federal systems division, which   has been hit with several executive defections, may also be put   on the block.       Contel officials declined to comment on the possibility of   selling any operations. However, the company indicated in a   statement that it was closely evaluating the telecommunications   and federal systems units.

grain	U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER   Prospects appear slim for a summer   meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two   countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains   agreement, Agriculture Department officials said.       The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the   agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up   to last February. However, any delay this year should not   endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends   through September, 1988, USDA officials said.       "It will be difficult to pull together the people for the   meeting during July," an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel   Amstutz said.       Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the   next talks could still be a "couple more months," he said.             There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA   will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next   marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations   were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.       "I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer   or before the next agreement year begins," a USDA source said.       Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next   year's crops, he said, "There are too many variables now. It   would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now."       Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a   minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and   U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of   a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping   logistics and production outlooks.

acq	JUSTICE OPPOSES QUICK GREYHOUND-TRAILWAYS MERGER   The Justice Department said it asked   the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the   nation's two largest intercity bus companies to merge their   operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal.       Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by   Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp   prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the   Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger   plan.       Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company   hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow.       "Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only   if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control   of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its   operations," Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the   federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers   of interstate bus companies.       But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that   it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn   down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways   immediately.       "The department has just begun to receive relevant   information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the   process of assessing the correctness of the company's   allegations," acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule   said in comments submitted to the ICC.       Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let   it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to   evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.       Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of   Trailways' terminals, buses and garages.       The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that   Trailways "could collapse in a matter of days."       They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs,   with another six mln dlrs due June 30.       The suppliers, they said, could force Trailways into   bankruptcy "at any time."       Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and   the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways   fails to pay the interest due June 30, they said.

tea	STATE TO CONTROL 70 PCT OF PAKISTAN TEA IMPORTS   Pakistan announced a new tea import   policy, saying 70 pct of imports will in future be made through   the state Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP).      Commerce Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a television   broadcast that no more than one-third of the remaining 30 pct   allocated to the private sector would be permitted to come from   any one country.      The new policy was announced some three months after the   government suspended import licences and ordered an inquiry   into tea purchase policy.      Traders said the move was designed to put pressure on Kenya,   which provided some 48 pct of Pakistan's 75-80 mln kilo annual   tea imports, to buy Pakistani manufactured goods in exchange.       Liptons and Brooke Bond, two units of Britain's Unilever   Plc, control 95 pct of Pakistan's hard-pack tea market, traders   said.

jobs	JAPAN UNEMPLOYMENT RISES TO RECORD 3.2 PCT IN MAY   Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment   rate rose to a record 3.2 pct in May, the worst level since the   government started compiling unemployment statistics in 1953,   the government's Management and Coodination Agency said.       The May rate surpassed the previous record of 3.0 pct   marked set in January and April this year. It was also up   sharply from 2.7 pct a year earlier.       Unadjusted May unemployment totalled 1.91 mln people, up   from 1.90 mln in April and 1.62 mln a year earlier.       An agency official blamed industrial restructuring and the   strong yen for the rise in unemployment.       The seasonally adjusted male unemployment rate in May rose   to a record 3.2 pct, surpassing the previous record 3.0 pct set   in July 1986. This compares with 2.9 pct in April and 2.7 pct a   year earlie. Unadjusted male unemployment totalled 1.12 mln, up   180,000 from a year earlier.       The female unemployment rate in May was unchanged from   April at a record 3.1 pct. A year ago, the rate was 2.8 pct.   Unadjusted female unemployment rose 100,000 to 790,000.       The yen's appreciation continued to affect employment in   manufacturing industries and the total employed in May fell   210,000 or 1.5 pct from a year earlier to 14.10 mln.
money-fx	MIYAZAWA SAYS G-7 STILL SUPPORTS LOUVRE ACCORD   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa   said the Group of Seven (G-7) nations still support the Louvre   Accord to stabilise currencies.       He also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting   that the Group of Five (G-5) and G-7 do not have any plans to   meet for talks.       The Finance Minister further said that overseas stock   market plunges will not lead to a freefall in the Tokyo stock   market. "There is no special worry about the stock market in   Tokyo," he added.       Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely   affected by the downturns of markets in New York and London   because there is a clear sign of an economic recovery in Japan   and stability of exchange rates.       Asked if the U.S. Had contacted Japan after the stock   market plunge in New York, Miyazawa said there was not any   contact.

crude:ship	JAPAN UNDERSTANDS U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN OIL PLATFORM   Japan said it understood why the U.S.   Attacked an Iranian oil platform on Monday.       "Japan, deeply concerned over the increasing threat to the   ships navigating in the Gulf, understands the circumstances   that have led the United States government to take these   measures," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.       The statement added that the threat to free and safe   navigation had increased after the missile attack on a   U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti territorial waters last Friday.
crude	VENEZUELA SEES FLAT OIL PRICE DESPITE U.S. ATTACK   World oil prices would remain stable   despite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and   growing tension in the Gulf, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo   Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.       He described the situation as "extremely tense," but said   Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices   because supply and demand were roughly equal.       Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5   mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now   pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference.       Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was   precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their   current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction   continued.       Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of   Petroleum Exporting Countries were "overproducing in an   exaggerated manner" above their assigned quotas, he said.       OPEC's overall ceiling is 16.6 mln bpd.
money-fx	IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST   If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,   Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a   serious way, Japan investment managers say.       The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar   securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.       But "if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen   yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw   significant funds from U.S. Shares," said Akira Kawakami, deputy   manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's   international investment department.       An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese   investment in U.S. Bonds. "Japan-U.S. Interest rate   differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing   in the absence of dollar stability," said Kawakami.       U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture   following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.   Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect   should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.       But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating   to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was   holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.       "Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in   New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to   lighten their U.S. Stock inventories," Hiromitsu Sunada, manager   of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment   department said.       Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points   to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.       "Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,   considering the dangers," said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general   manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed   income securities marketing group.       Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once   markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers   said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one   or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.   The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for   the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.       "The basic background which has supported the stocks and   bonds markets has not changed," said Norio Okutsu, assistant   general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. "But new   outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing."  However,   this was already evident three months ago, he said.
cocoa	ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS   Asian cocoa producers are expanding   output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss   suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.       "Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market   from our product," said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate   general of plantations. "We're happy about our long-term future."       Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in   Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable   for European tastes.       They were responding to comments by London traders that   large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia   and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa   prices.       London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered   unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a   high level of free fatty acids.       Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'   Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the   United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western   Europe.       A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the   London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with   high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.       "When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to   talk down prices," the spokesman said.       He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.       PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa   year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported   to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the   Netherlands and Britain.       The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official   who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem   with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described   criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as "trade politics"   and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it   did not have any difficulty with exports.       Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity   producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the   International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).       Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to   total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.       This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of   the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest   cocoa growing area.       Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600   tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is   projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes   this year as young trees mature.       Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and   traders said they could last out low prices longer than West   African countries.       According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would   have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to   make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.       Some traders believe the main quality problem is with   harvesting and fermentation techniques.       One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually   indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the   same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian   estates.
crude	MALAYSIA ADVISED TO RAISE CRUDE OIL OUTPUT IN 1988   Malaysia's national oil company,   Petronas, has advised the government to raise crude oil output   to 540,000 barrels a day (bpd) in 1988 from a current 500,000   bpd, a senior company official said.       "We have the capacity to produce the amount," Rastam Hadi,   Petronas's Vice-President for Upstream Sector said.       The government will announce its decision on Friday when it   unveils the country's budget. Malaysia raised output this month   to current levels from 420,000 bpd after reviewing the world   oil market. In May, Malaysia cut output to 420,000 bpd from   459,000 in response to a call by OPEC to boost prices.

Russell said the bank had two statutory responsibilities --   to implement the government's monetary policy to bring down   inflation, and to ensure the financial sector's stability.       "Unless the bank is directed otherwise, the firm monetary   policy will continue because it is very much in the national   interest that it do so," he said.       "And there is yet no evidence available to the bank to   suggest that the fall in share prices has affected the   stability of the financial sector."

The cotton, worth one billion shillings, cannot be moved to   ginneries in the region because most mill warehouses are full.   Many mills are not working because of a lack of spare parts, it   added.       Agriculture Ministry officials have forecast a 1987/88   cotton harvest of about 200,000 tonnes, down from 215,000 in   1986/87.
interest	AQUINO SAYS MANILA WATCHING INTEREST RATES CLOSELY   President Corazon Aquino said the   Philippines was closely monitoring interest rates in the wake   of Monday's record drop on Wall Street and steep declines in   Manila and other Asian stock markets.       "We will monitor these developments closely and will   continue to hope that they do not precipitate large declines in   economic activity around the world," Aquino told a meeting of 13   major Philippine business groups.       "The Philippines, as a trading country in the world economy,   depends on the continued health and growth of both the world   economy and the world trading system," she said.       The Manila Stock Exchange composite index plunged 105.49   points or 11.79 pct by the midday close to 789.54, depressed by   the record 508 point fall of the Dow Jones industrial average   on Monday.       "The Philippines, in addition, as a large borrower nation,   is affected by developments in interest rate levels around the   world and will carefully monitor the impact of these   developments on interest rates, on gold and on commodity   prices," Aquino said.       "We welcome the statements from world leaders that urge calm   in the present difficult situation," she added.

In August   the rate of increase was 11.0 pct.
crude:ship	WORLD COULD COPE WITH HORMUZ CLOSURE, SUBROTO SAYS   Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if   conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil   supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,   Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.       He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military   action in the Gulf.       But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian   Petroleum Association, he said, "If worst comes to worst and say   the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely   shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,   can take care of the situation."       "But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short   duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of   the situation," he declared.       Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively   short-term impact on prices, he added.       Assessing future price trends, he said, "Short-term spot   prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely   hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per   barrel.       "The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater   than the downward ones."       "The balance between supply and demand in the short term   will still be delicate," he added. "Non-Opec production may still   go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase   in world demand."       Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which   has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play   havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the   situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.       In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a   plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he   said.

interest	POEHL SAYS RATE RISES ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN   Rises in West German and international   interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has   no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank   President Karl Otto Poehl said.       "We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred   here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,"   Poehl told an investment conference.       "I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest   in higher capital market rates," he said.       Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a   tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80   pct.       Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have   seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct   at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in   late September.       The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to   3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections   of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.       These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting   between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.   Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.       Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed   their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.       Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in   West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the   dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.       But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in   nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.       Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not   due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and   currency developments.       Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said "You   have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a   policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears."    The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he   said.       Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,   saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to   international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.       The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money   supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.       "Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of   1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest   rates have risen substantially more," Poehl said.       This had to be taken into account when considering recent   rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to   rising international money market rates that had spilled over   into the German market, he said.       Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far   ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.       "The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is   definitely underway," he said, noting that this was not so   noticeable in absolute figures.       The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also   attracted little attention, he said.
acq	LAWSON SAYS BP SHARE OFFER GOING AHEAD   U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel   Lawson said the Government was going ahead with this month's   flotation of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> shares despite the   collapse on international stock markets.       "We are going ahead because the whole issue has been   underwritten - we had it underwritten because there is always a   risk of this sort of thing happening," Lawson said in a BBC   radio interview.       Lawson's remarks came as renewed selling on the London   stock market took BP shares down a further 33p to 283, well   below the 330p price set for the around seven billion stg   issue.       Lawson said the U.K. Economy is fundamentally sound and   added that stock markets had reflected that recently.       "I profoundly believe in the market system as the best way   for securing economic prosperity (but) that does not mean to   say the markets are infallible."       "My advice to small investors...Is to remain calm. There is   absolutely no reason not to do so," Lawson said.
coconut	PHILIPPINES APPLAUDS DEFEAT OF U.S. LABELLING BILL   The Philippine coconut industry has   greeted with relief the defeat in the U.S. Senate of a bill   requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.       The bill, which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture   Committee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year   in lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.       "Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the   bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another   Senate bill," a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of   the Philippines (UCAP).       PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, with   eight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.       The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association   (ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.       He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during   the debate.       "Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated   animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems   leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease," he said.       U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that   saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would   discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour   of domestic unsaturated alternatives.       Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated   against imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia and   Indonesia.       The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products   in 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.       Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible use   account for about half of that total, PCA's Romero said.
interest	TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY   Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent   the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even   force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,   government and private economists said.       A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark   further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major   deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.       Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently   maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount   rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.        Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the   central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance   higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.       But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15   pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to   raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a   renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.       Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the   markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded   the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount   rate increase.       A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.   And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a   further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. "They need to   support the stock and security markets," he said.       But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change   policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central   bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices   continue to plunge during the rest of the week.       Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the   economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary   impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.       With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in   stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and   business confidence, one government economist said.       "There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't   be that big," said another.       Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their   own, although they do participate through trust funds and other   investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned   to financial market investments for profits during last year's   economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to   refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.       Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is   partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have   shifted funds away from financial investments to increase   inventories and step up capital spending, one government   economist said.       In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price   drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices   will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a   greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,   one central bank official said. "That will at least take a   couple of days, if not weeks," he said.

money-fx	STOLTENBERG SAYS BAKER MEETING UNDERSCORES ACCORD   West German Finance minister Gerhard   Stoltenberg said the meeting on Monday with U.S. Treasury   Secretary James Baker underscored the determination of the U.S.   And West Germany to continue close cooperation to stabilise   foreign exchange rates.       Stoltenberg told a news conference "The statement released   yesterday (Monday) after the private meeting .... Emphasized   our determination to continue the close economic cooperation   regarding foreign exchange stabilization and monetary policy."       Stoltenberg said that he, Baker and Bundesbank President   Karl Otto Poehl had a very constructive discussion and had all   reached a positive evaluation of the Louvre accord during their   meeting on Monday.       Stoltenberg said initial contacts with several European   counterparts showed that they shared this view. "We expect the   declaration of our unified position to have a positive effect,"   he said.       He noted that the dollar firmed again in late U.S. Trading   after the outcome of the Baker meeting was published.
rubber	INRO COUNCIL MEETING ADJOURNED UNTIL THURSDAY   A Council meeting of the   International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) has been   adjourned until Thursday as tomorrow is a Malaysian national   holiday, officials of the organisation said.       The main issue at the talks, which opened here yesterday,   has been the INRO buffer stock and the manner in which the   buffer stock manager should continue to sell rubber after the   current international pact for the commodity expires on October   22, they said.       The deadline for the start of the new pact is January 1989.       Buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister has been mandated to   continue selling rubber during the interim period.       Other issues discussed include ratification of the new   accord, the officials said.       Only Malaysia of the pact's 32 producing and consuming   member countries had ratified the new agreement by the   beginning of this month.       The meeting is due to end on Thursday.
money-fx	LOUVRE ACCORD VITAL TO W.GERMANY - STOLTENBERG   West German Finance Minister Gerhard   Stoltenberg said the Louvre accord was vital to West Germany.       Stoltenberg told a news conference "Given West Germany's   unusually high dependence on world trade and exports, it is   vital for West Germany ... To continue its constructive   contribution to trusting (international) cooperation on the   basis of the Louvre accord."       Some monetary analysts have speculated that   inflation-conscious Bundesbank vice president Helmut   Schlesinger may have been leading the central bank to a course   of tighter monetary policy.       Stoltenberg is due to attend a routine Bundesbank meeting   on Thursday in West Berlin. He declined to forecast what, if   any, policy decisions the Bundesbank might take.

He was asked about target zones at a news conference in   Bonn.

This was the   same formula used in the text of the Louvre accord, he noted.

crude	IRAN SAYS U.S. RAID CAUSED 500 MLN DLRS DAMAGE   U.S. Attacks on two Iranian oil platforms   in the Gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused   damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs, Tehran Radio quoted Iranian   Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.       The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American   destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after   the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the Gulf,   the minister told a news conference in Tehran. He said the   Reshadat rigs, 120 miles (200 km) east of Bahrain in   international waters, were in the final stages of   reconstruction after an attack by Iraqi jets last year.
crude:ship	IRANIAN PREMIER REITERATES WARNING OF RETALIATION   Iranian Premier Mir-Hossein Mousavi   reiterated his country would retaliate for U.S. Navy attacks on   Gulf oil platforms.       "The U.S. Attack on Iran's oil platforms jeopardises our   national sovereignty ... And we will retaliate properly for   this perfidious American aggression," Mousavi told a news   conference in Damascus.  On Monday U.S. Navy warships blasted   the Rostam platform, and Navy personnel stormed a second   platform a few miles away. Washington said the operation was   aimed at destroying positions used by Iran to track and assault   neutral Gulf shipping.
crude:nat-gas	INDONESIA FINDS NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS RESOURCES   The Indonesian state-owned oil company   Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East   Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company   spokesman said.       The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1   offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh.       "Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300   metres within the Baong formation," he said.       He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow   oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at   20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke.       "The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln   standard cubic feet a day," he added.       GOS IA-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was   drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina   and Japex North Sumatra Ltd, each having 50 pct shares.       "Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as   operator through a joint operating body established by the two   companies," the Pertamina spokesman stated.       The contract covers the Gebang block contract area. The two   companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1   exploratory well, around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1.
crude	INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS   Indonesia told the oil industry on   Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and   improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased   expenditure on exploration in return.       President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian   Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend   contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.       "In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the   government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending   production sharing contracts under the present laws," Suharto   said.       "Apart from that, the government will keep improving the   investment climate in order to accelerate the development of   the petroleum industry," he said.       Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he   was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that   contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be   renewed before they would invest in further exploration.       "As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully   aware of this situation," Subroto said.       "The government has already made the political decision to   entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers   to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a   selective basis."       Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil   reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil   industry sources say.       Subroto said the government was also working to ease other   problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or   deep water conditions.       But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way   and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now   that the oil price had recovered.       President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of   technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil   industry for the regions in which companies operated.       Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company   Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production   expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to   fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in   1986.       Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation   contracts with foreign oil companies.       Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field   operations was a government priority. There had been   misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry   in certain areas, such as when a field is designated   commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.       He said the government wanted to finalise contract   extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the   meantime to maintain its exploration drive.       Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain   exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire   within 10 years. "This need in itself is some sort of guarantee   that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement."       Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal   between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.       Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved   detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.       Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions   would be selective, based on how much capital would be   invested.

crude:ship	IRAN PLANS TO FILE LAWSUITS OVER U.S. RAID   Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for   compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf   oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister   Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.       The lawsuits would be filed with competent international   bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted   telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the   damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.       The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American   destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after   the attack, he said.       Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was   preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to   a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle   City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.       He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs   "except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence." Reacting to   Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,   Aqazadeh said: "Iran will also consider the case closed after   its retaliatory measure." Iranian officials have said their   response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests   around the world might come under attack.       Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf   aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's   oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack   significantly affecting oil prices.       IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the   attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the   entrance to the Gulf.       "If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can   either, and this would be to everyone's harm," the radio quoted   him as saying.

housing	U.S. HOUSING STARTS ROSE 4.4 PCT IN SEPTEMBER   U.S. housing starts rose 4.4 pct in   September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,669,000   units, the Commerce Department said.       In August, housing starts were unchanged from July levels   at 1,598,000 units, instead of being down 1.5 pct as previously   reported.

The rate at which permits were issued for future   construction fell 0.6 pct in September to a seasonally adjusted   1,493,000 units from 1,502,000 units in August.       Permits had risen 1.0 pct in August from July levels of   1,487,000 units.       Before seasonal adjustment, permits rose to 135,500 in   September from 128,000 in August.       Housing starts before adjustment rose to 150,200 in   September from 144,600 in August.       The seasonally adjusted rise in starts included a 5.1 pct   increase in September single-family unit starts to 1,168,000    from 1,111,000 in August.       Single-family starts had fallen 2.8 pct in August from July   levels.       Multi-family starts rose 2.9 pct in September to a   seasonally adjusted 501,000 units after a 7.0 pct increase in   August, the department said.       Permits for single-family units fell 3.2 pct last month to   a seasonally adjusted 990,000 units after a 3.0 pct August   rise.       Multi-family permits were up 5.0 pct in September to   503,000 units after falling 3.0 pct in August.       Housing starts in September were down 1.2 pct from a   seasonally adjusted 1,689,000 units in September 1986.       Permits were 11.5 pct below the September 1986 level of   1,687,000 units.

Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16   percentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half a   point (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday),   and the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday's   average of 7.61 pct.

coffee	U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED   A voluntary compliance system for   monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed   skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and   trade sources.       "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and    importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of   the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it   became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one   analyst said.       On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said   the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a   voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to   monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.       Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee   importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the   U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring   authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,   it will still be allowed entry.       While many believe producers will not seek to add to the   overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some   will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of   monitoring controls, trade sources said.       "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted   to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a   U.S. Customs spokesman said.       "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when   its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand   Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to   destination)," he said.       Many see it as a true test of whether producers and   importers will abide by the quota system.       "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the   quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.        "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did   not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without   the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the   producers' hands."       Some feel that importers will take advantage of the   voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,   in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.   Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member   countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely   labelled.       According to customs officials, several green coffee   importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee   fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,   forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy   beans.       "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for   one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of   their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by   circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst   Bernie Savaiko.       Still, others believe that producers will not be hard   pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in   the U.S. in the near term.       "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not   have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system   seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so   much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a   threat," one trader said.

meal-feed:oilseed:rapeseed:soy-meal:soybean:sunseed	OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION   Oilmeal demand remained strong in the   United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen   in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in   soymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.       Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to   a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct   on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at   seven pct, it said.       Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and   330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months   following a huge increase in soymeal imports.       Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately   but went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it   estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by   October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.       EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year   earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,   sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to   bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record   5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposals   were reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mln   at that time last year.

Reagan said the accord is designed to stabilize rubber   prices without disturbing long-term market trends and to foster   expanded natural rubber supplies at reasonable prices.       It continues a buffer stock of not more than 550,000 tonnes   established by a 197agreement. This will be used to defend a   regularly adjusted price range and will be financed equally by   importing and exporting members of the agreement.
grain:wheat	NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG   The Soviets have not indicated an   urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely   that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit   expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard   Lyng told Reuters.       In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did   not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat   subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.       "Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.   There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that   there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a   wheat subsidy)."       When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet   summit, Lyng said, "No, I don't think so. I don't think that."       The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to   Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for   discussion at a summit.       "It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the   Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions   about," Lyng said.       "When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for   agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was   not something that would be discussed with the President of the   United States. He said it's not presidential," Lyng said.       Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major   producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the   still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final   decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.       The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement   will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the   Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the   long-standing agreement.       "We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have   failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would   love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,   but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.   These are some of the questions we need to discuss."       When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from   the agreement, Lyng said, "I don't know. It certainly hasn't   been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running   they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an   agreement."
veg-oil	LYNG SAYS INDIA FOOD AID PACKAGE NOT READY   The United States and India have   not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the   drought-stricken Asian country, Agriculture Secretary Richard   Lyng said.       Lyng told Reuters in an interview that the two countries   have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the   specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime   Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week.       "We have been talking about the potential needs that India   might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs   as well as the possibilities of assistance," Lyng said.       "At this point, there is no detailed plan or program. The   amounts of what commodities are uncertain. But we have   indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in   whatever way they deem most valuable," he said.       There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would   offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export   enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419   of an amended 1949 law.       Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree   on the mix of concessional and commercial aid, and that   Washington would prefer the package include something other   than donated food.       "The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot, of taking care   of themselves. India is a country that has come a long way in   its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in   that," Lyng said.       "We (the United States) obviously, with the surpluses we   still have of many commodities..., would like to share in the   import business the Indians do, and then we have some, as we   always do, compassion for the people of India and would like to   cooperate with them," he said.       Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials   during Gandhi's visit here, adding, "I just don't know of   anything that might be announced specifically."       Asked if "the ball was in the Indians' court," he said, "Yes."       Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening.

money-fx	LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS   U.S. And West German reaffirmation of   support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental   problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the   current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.       "There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the   dollar is going to be allowed to slip," said Richard Jeffrey of   Hoare Govett. "If not, there is going to be continued fear that   when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to   tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the   U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world."       But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which   dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the   very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation   fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.       "If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street   ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide," said   Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from   other London and Tokyo analysts.       Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of   further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary   pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.       Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the   equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.       "It would be suicidal for any government in the context of   what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their   interest rates," he added.       Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime   lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed   chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial   system.       The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock   collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking   crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.       It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of   1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said   today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and   that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in   mind.       "The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.   If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic   growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a   more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy," said Capel's   Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in   danger.       "The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is   disappearing from the equity markets," Dennis noted.       David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world   market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven   (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,   as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard   Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies   is still on.       Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by   expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money   supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency   stability.       But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said   Morrison. "The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To   stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong," he said.
ship	NEW CONTAINER CRANES ARRIVE AT TANZANIA PORT   Two large container cranes donated   by the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) have   arrived in Dar es Salaam where they will help to increase the   port's cargo handling capacity, port officials said.       The two new container cranes join one Danish container   crane already installed in the port, which is an important   trade outlet for Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and eastern Zaire.       Five more cranes from Finland are due to arrive soon,   increasing the container terminal's handling capacity to   120,000 units per year from 30,000 at present, the officials   said.
interest	U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA   An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg   surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to   nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as   long as sterling remains in its present robust state,   economists said.       An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the   past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit   demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.       "In the normal course of events the markets would have been   extremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K.   Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.       After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,   which compared won stg August rise, U.K.   Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee   from plummetting equities into the relative security of   government securities.       Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a   day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,   before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone   throughout.       U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,   resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning   after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.       Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks   would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a   rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "With   the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last   thing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said.       "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as   sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"   said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu   Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money   measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct   growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.       But "The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed   down is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K.   Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a   fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money   aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.       It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank   of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates   to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by   news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.       Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in   that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.       Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in   influencing consumer behaviour, he said.       In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity   markets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be a   straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail   sales," Temperton said.       "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in   consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added.       "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending   figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very   serious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said.       A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look   at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,   adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly   than bank lending.       Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending   was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy   personal sector borrowing.       Figures from the Banking Information Service showed   personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66   billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much   of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.
interest:money-fx	FED EXPECTED TO ADD RESERVES VIA CUSTOMER RPS   The Federal Reserve is expected to enter   the government securities market to add reserves via customer   repurchase agreements, economists said.       They expected the amount to total around 1.5 billion to two   billion dlrs.       Economists added that the low rate on federal funds   indicates the Fed is unlikely to add funds agressively through   overnight system repurchases, unless it feels the need to calm   volatile financial markets.       Federal funds were trading at 7-1/8 pct, down from   yesterday's average of 7.61 pct.
reserves	TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT RECORD HIGH   Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, bouyed   by rising exports, have hit a record high and are likely to   soar to 72 billion U.S. Dlrs by the year end, central bank   officials said Tuesday.       Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the   reserves totalled about 69 billion U.S. Dlrs, compared with   about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on   October 5. He declined to elaborate.       A senior bank official, who declined to be named, told   Reuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at   the end of the year.       "The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus   and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank   market," Chang said.       Taiwan's trade surplus hit a record 14.95 billion U.S. Dlrs   in the first nine months of 1987 compared with 11.05 billion a   year earlier, official figures show.       Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-hsien said the surplus   will rise to about 20 billion dlrs by the end of the year.   About 80 pct of the surplus will come from the island's trade   with the United States.        Chien said Taiwan's trade will reach 80 billion U.S. Dlrs   this year compared with 63.96 billion last year.       Its exports are expected to total 50 billion and imports 30   billion against exports of 39.79 billion and imports of 24.17   billion last year.

crude	NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER   Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2   pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in   August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.       Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at   several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at   fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field   rescue project.       Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's   voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil   output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise   oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.       Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the   production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all   its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.       Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway   would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.       The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which   pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,   field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.       Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use   the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while   Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.       BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula   field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping   to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.       Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd   last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company   said.       September production was also sharply higher at the   Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which   extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd   against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats   Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.       Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like   Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd   in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous   month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.       Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd   in September, compared with 100,188 in August.       Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test   output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl   totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in   August.       Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on   stream a second well, cutting September production to just two   days.

crude:ship	IRAN LEADER VOWS REVENGE ON US RAID IN COMING DAYS   Iran's top war spokesman Ali Akbar   Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the U.S. Attacks on two of   its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.       "God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days   and make them sorry," said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament   later broadcast by Tehran Radio.       The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance   after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.       President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi   and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have all   vowed retaliation.       Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, "It is not a   threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will   respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it   in practice." He added that the American attack "squares neither   with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with   security, nor reason and wisdom."       U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and   American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.       The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response   to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti   tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday.

soybean:trade:veg-oil	LYNG PLEASED EC TO OFFER GATT FARM PROPOSAL   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard   Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a   global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the   United States opposes key parts of the proposal.       "We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.   It will help us in getting the negotiations underway," Lyng   told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.       Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg   endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.   The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay   round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.       Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan   seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing   curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.       The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all   farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has   pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching   a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.       However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the   Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is   unrealistic.       Asked about such criticism, Lyng said "The alternative to   doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I   think that is the unrealistic position."       "I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are   trying to say."       Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a   freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations    started.       "All that some countries would like to have would be a   wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.   That doesn't do a thing for us," Lyng said.       The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of   agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he   said.       At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is   expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.       The United States will be represented at the meeting by   former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently   appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.

The increases will affect certain non-contract or spot   transactions and will be achieved through reductions in   competitive discounts.       The company said transaction prices for contract accounts,   which have a duration of six months or more, will also be   increased to commensurate levels.       Percentage increases were not immediately available.       Prices for flat-rolled steel sheet, used in automobiles,   appliances and other products, vary widely between about 350   and 800 dlrs a ton.       The company said it was taking the actions to restore sheet   transaction prices to more equitable levels. In many cases,   prices are still lower than those attained in 1984, it said.       Bethlehem also said that in response to changing market   conditions and potential inflationary pressures, efforts will   be made to mininize the number and the duration of firm price   contracts.

coffee	IBC SEEKS EXPORT DETAILS TO SET COFFEE QUOTAS   The Brazilian Coffee Institute   (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to   submit details of past export performance in order that   individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.       He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed   acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals   to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export   performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.       Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive   months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be   used for calculating the export performace portion.       The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers   participation and use this as a basis for allocation of   individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.       He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo   Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate.   Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable   on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this   premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export   sales declaration form.       Auctions will not start until after the opening of export   registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be   but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of   the week, opening registraions from Monday.       A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the   CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for   allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,   the spokesman added.       A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished   in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure   shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.

veg-oil	COPA URGES TAX ON VEGETABLE PROTEINS   The European Community's farmers'   pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax   on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax   which has already been proposed by the EC Commission.       Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on   Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism   for cereal substitutes.       He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the   Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair   meetings of their EC colleagues.       Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help   the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability   for producers.       This would in turn help the market position for certain   crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas   and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe   output restrictions.       A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax   on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats   succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC   price fixing.       However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its   proposals for a tax.       Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue   international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of   bridging the gap between EC and world prices.

acq	JACOBS SELLS STAKE IN GILLETTE &lt;GS>   Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs said he   sold the stake he held in Gillette Co &lt;GS> after deciding that   he could not force Gillette to accept a 47 dlr a share takeover   bid made by Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV>.       Revlon's bid expired last week after being repeatedly   rejected by Gillette. Jacobs had earlier considered waging a   proxy fight over Gillette.       Jacobs told Reuters he sold the Gillette stake, which he   called "substantial" but under five pct, a few weeks ago over a   period of several days. He said he sold the stock at a profit,   but did not disclose the selling price.       Gillette's stock was at 24-1/8, up 1/8, in morning trade,   off the high of 45-7/8 reached after Revlon announced its bid.       Jacobs said he sold his Gillette stake based on an   "investment decision. I surely did not see this happening," he   said of Monday's stock market free-fall.       A Gillette spokesman said the mpany had no comment.       Jacobs said he and fellow investor Carl Pohlad continue to   hold a stake in Allegheny International Inc &lt;AG>. In August   they disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing   that they had acquired 854,900 shares, or 7.9 pct, of Allegheny   and would consideer seeking control of the company.

interest	DONALD REGAN SAYS U.S. SHOULD EASE CREDIT SUPPLY   Donald Regan, President Reagan's   former chief of staff, said the government should loosen the   money supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reduce   the federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.       "I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve our   economy," the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc   &lt;MER> said in an interview on the ABC television network.       "We've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest rates   down. We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're going   to have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficit   and the trade deficit," Regan said.        "I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particular   moment," Regan said when asked about the prospects for a   recession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street.       "I think that if they were to do that, they'd create the   same conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the money   supply and what happened? We went into a major recession. I   think that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now."       Regan also called on the government to impose restrictions   on program trading. "I think that that's exacerbated,   exaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that they   must stop," he said.

carcass:trade	GATT CASE AGAINST JAPAN A MODEL FOR U.S. - LYNG   Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng   said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint   against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in   negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.       The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan   end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the   end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will   favor the U.S.       "These are quota items, and the principles that apply to   them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of   whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus," Lyng   told Reuters in an interview.       He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on   beef and citrus after March 31, next year.       The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United   States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some   cheeses and specialty fruit juices.       U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would   be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has   been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.       The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus   quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect   Japanese farmers.       "We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on   beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an   illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.       He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next   April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.

tin	TIN COUNCIL ALLOWED APPEAL ON USE OF DOCUMENTS   Britain's highest court has decided the   International Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC   documents in court actions.       On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what   extent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissible   as court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left   from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this   hearing is likely to last a few days.       On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding   ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of   hearings could begin in early January, they added.       The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will   be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies   against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case   is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.       The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers   and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member   governments of the tin council.       Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the   ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by   the Court of Appeal legal schedule.

oilseed:soybean:trade:veg-oil	ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT   The American Soybean Association (ASA)   denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal   under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and   threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not   remedy the situation.       ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored   Outlook 87 conference: "It will be filed unless the EC takes   drastic and immediate steps."       "These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,   since they were established after the zero soybean duty was   established in 1962," he said.       The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask   for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to   make the regime non-discriminatory.       The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in   an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production   has risen dramatically since then.       The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world   market levels and is considering implementing a controversial   oils and fats tax.       The subsidies "are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero   duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell," Adams   said.       The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its   trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an   EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the   EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.       U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in   volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of   EC policies, Adams added.       Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at   the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973   when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.
carcass:livestock:sugar:trade	U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES   The United States is prepared to "pull out   all the stops" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador   to GATT Michael Samuels said.       Those rights are now being challenged by the European   Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a   conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.       He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if   the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without   the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.       The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect   on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat   shipments into the EC.       The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.   trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed   prices over the current market level and which may be extended   to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.       Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,   an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade   negotiations, "is meaningless if import barriers continue to be   erected," Samuels said.       Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm   subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, "visionary"   and "very serious."  The EC and Japan have said it is   unrealistic.       The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal   on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally   next week.       The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce   tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals   substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of   farm subsidies.       The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as   they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major   trade distortions, Samuels said.       Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally   submitted and respond to it officially then.       "We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este   declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"   the U.S. Ambassador said.       The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores   the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.       The key difference between the two approaches is that the   U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing   only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.       If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,   there would be little incentive for the Community to work to   correct the international trade situation, he added.       Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC   oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to   third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the   U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the U.S.   sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with   any Iranian response to Monday's attack on an Iranian oil rig.       Several hours later, the Pentagon announced that U.S.   warships had begun escorting two U.S. flag Kuwaiti tankers --   the 80,000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 ton   liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait.       The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of U.S.   flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT   under the escort by the U.S. guided missile frigate Ford. It   did not say what oth U.S. warships were in the area.       "It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the   central Gulf," the Pentagon statement said.       Asked on NBC's "Today" program if the United States was   prepared for a major war with Iran, Weinberger said, "Well we   are prepared I think for whatever eventualities emerge from   this situation but we don't look on it as a war."

trade	LYNG DEFENDS U.S. EXPORT SUBSIDY PROGRAM   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard   Lyng said the United States will continue its policy of   subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is   a global agreement to end such subsidies.       In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was   troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program   (EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting U.S. exports   that the U.S. would have difficulty abandoning it.       "Yes, I'm troubled with that a little bit," he said. "There's   no question about it, the longer you feed the calf on the cow,   the longer it is to wean it."       In recent months, USDA has offered subsidies on a growing   list of commodities to an increasing number of countries.       Lyng called U.S. and European Community export subsidies   "just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy" and said he saw an   end to the expansion of the EEP.       "I'm sure there's an end to the expansion, but we are doing   this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that   we've lost, to keep our products competitive and to let those,   particularly the European Community, who, we are convinced, are   the worst offenders in terms of the export subsidization, that   we are prepared to continue to do this until we can come to   some agreement to put an end to it," he said.

Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday   at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.       He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil   deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an   upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation   which began in late 1983.       Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,   slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.       January-September figures released at the weekend showed   Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467   mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.       Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil   deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog   prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.       The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988   budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.

He said in a television interview the dispute had fanned   fears of a breakdown in the cooperation which is so important   between finance ministers of the major nations.       He said the dispute was a row which should not have   happened and agreed that much of the blame lay with U.S.   Treasury Secretary James Baker who had publicly criticised West   Germany for having raised its key interest rates.

interest:money-fx	BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE   The United States appears to have won a   transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest   rates, European economists said.       But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing   the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were   plunging.       West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.   Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to   currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,   according to official statements released late Monday.       Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the   Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks   liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct   facility rate offered last week.       While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank   president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added   money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a   strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.        "It's round one to the Americans, " said Richard Reid,   senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in   London.       But Reid added, "We shouldn't forget that it has taken one   of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West   Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05   percentage point."       Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening   of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and   fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.       Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's   Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary   policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -   the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.       The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets   and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading   in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was   quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.       Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche   Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world   stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West   German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.       "The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market   losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits   with Baker's wishes, then all the better," he said.       No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the   Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises   in the U.S., Aschoff said.       Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central   bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he   thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.       Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston   Ltd in London said "The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat   and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the   security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was   before the IMF meeting last month in Washington."       Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was   reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity   at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.       Economists said the United States now appeared to have   agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support   the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.       Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder   Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg   told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule   out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening   on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.       Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West   Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency   stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central   banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them   to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

carcass:grain:livestock:trade:wheat	EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA   The European Community (EC) agreed a   trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country   following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC   officials said.       Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina   will gain additional trading rights on a series of products   including meat, fish and cereals by-products.       But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with   Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the   officials said.       The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC   states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased   quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.       Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,   saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals   substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the   officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from   improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the   quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500   tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will   be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.       Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of   5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced   levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.       The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said   that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their   exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They   have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement   on Tariffs and Trade).       But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve   Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had   been affected by the country's EC membership.       Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the   fish dispute with Canada.       Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC   claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has   improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied   with Japanese offers of compensation.       Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on   citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some   other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear   and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.       EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told   journalists: "We maintain our position that the (Japanese)   concessions were not enough."       "We hope that there will be an improvement," he said.

l-cattle:livestock	WEST VIRGINIA FREE OF TWO MAJOR CATTLE DISEASES   West Virginia has been declared free   of tuberculosis and brucellosis from its cattle population, the   U.S. Agriculture Department said.       It said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no   case of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if   the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the   state-federal cooperative eradication program.       To achieve brucellosis-free status, a state's cattle   population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.       There are 33 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands,   classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus   Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have eradicated   brucellosis. Only 20 states and the U.S. Virgin islands have   eradicated both diseases, it noted.
ship	US SENATE CUTS OFF STALL TACTICS ON GULF BILL   Confronted by new hostilities   involving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end   Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that   could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.       The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to   comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate   bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout   of U.S. forces from the Gulf.       The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit   debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan   to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls   for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the   situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.       The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue,   including an expression of support or of disapproval for   Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in   the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy   began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.

interest:money-fx	STOLTENBERG SAYS CRITICISM NOT "ONE-WAY STREET"   Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he   was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic   policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but   added that the criticism was not purely one-sided.       Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry   Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday,   "There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United   States)." He added. "Criticism is not a one-way street."       He did not elaborate, but Bonn has often called on the U.S.   To reduce its federal budget deficit.       Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic   policies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here   were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to   stabilise currencies.       Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with   Baker had resolved differences between the two countries.       At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had   declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms, but he   had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday, "one   remark or another has been clarified."
crude	US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS   U.S. military planners ruled out   Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack   mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the   Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.       U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and   raided another in what the administration called a "measured and   appropriate response" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last   Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.       Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig   rather than an onshore economic or military target such as   Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to   limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at   home and in the Gulf.       "It simply demonstrated the United States will take military   action when they (Iran) take military action," Norman Polmar, a   defense analyst and author, said.       He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the   embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding   an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.       In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the   potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that   could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.       Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq   war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target   to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General   Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a   Security Council call for a ceasefire.       "We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any   chance at all," he said, adding that the action made it clear   tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.         In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon   to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington   also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's   economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had   been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the   lower Gulf.       "We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown   Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting   capabilities," Cordesman said.       He predicted the United States would respond to any future   major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar   Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the   approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.       Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the   United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, "but   we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action   by Iran with stronger countermeasures."

corn:grain:trade	SPAIN APPEALS FOR EC HELP ON MAIZE IMPORTS   Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero,   speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action   to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources   said.       Spain is threatened with massive imports from third   countries by the end of the year, they said.       They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the   accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will   import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum   into Spain from third countries this year.       Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a   reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may   decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to   make direct purchases.       The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries   should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the   Spanish market.       They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC   Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached   would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.       The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the   meeting.

crude	OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF SALE POSTPONED   Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas   lease sale number 97 in the Beaufort Sea, tentatively   schedualed for January 1988 has been postponed, the U.S.   Department of Interior said.       Alan Powers, chief of the Minerals Maanagement Service for   the department, said the delay is to have more time to study   the effects of drilling noise on whale migrations.       Powers said the state has asked for additional noise data   for the sale area off Alaska's North Slope. A new date has not   been set, but it will likely be no sooner than next March,   Powers said.       Some 3,930 blocks encompassing about 21 mln acres are   involved in the proposed sale. The area is between three and   160 miles off the northern coast of Alaska in the Artic Ocean   between the Canadian border and 162 degrees west longitude.

However, the company said the plan will not be triggered by   purchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer   commenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a group   controlled by New York financier Asher Edelman.       It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one   basis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed   before they become exercisable at five cents per right.       The company said the rights will expire on the later of   February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become   exercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect   stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of   the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics   such as market accumulations which would interfere with its   ability to maximize stockholder value.       The rights become exercisable if any person or group   acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other   than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding   shares at 65 dlrs per share.        It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the   company is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its   board.        A spokeswoman told Reuters the company would have an   official response to Edelman's bid by Friday, Oct 23.

"The Saudis are being very cooperative. It would be nice if   the Saudis would go more public, but it's their real estate,"   said the official who asked not to be named.       He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were   providing, saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to   acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has   stationed forces to protect shipping lanes.       The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after   U.S. naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in   what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a   ship moored off Kuwait and flying the U.S. flag.       Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the   attack, the prince, who is here on an official visit, replied,   "I believe what the United States has done is their   responsibility as a superpower."

acq	BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING &lt;V>   The Bank of New York Corp &lt;BK> said it   reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite   the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a   Bank of New York spokesman said.       "The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer," a   Bank of New York spokesman said.       Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market   affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back   any of its own shares.       Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate   and said it wanted to retain its independence.       In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per   share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6   pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one   Irving share.       At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to   80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per   share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.       According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender   for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.       Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would   affect the acquisition.       "If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve   it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"   said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.       "And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"   Alpert said.       "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at   present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a   share, then they won't go at a lower price," another analyst   said.       The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford   to retain its original offer.       However, industry sources were more uncertain about   prospects for the deal.       "With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will   look good to Irving shareholders," said Michael Flores, a   consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.       The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is   about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases   the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.       Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely   to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking   industry.       "Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use   their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price   is too depressed," Alpert said.       Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other   possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.       "In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered   more than the acquirees," another analyst said.

crude:ship	US DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS ON HIGH ALERT OVER GULF   The State Department says many U.S.   diplomatic missions overseas are on high alert for possible   retaliation from Iran for Monday's attack on two Iranian oil   platforms by American forces in the Gulf.       At the same time, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday that   U.S. forces have begun escorting another Kuwaiti tanker convoy   southward through the Gulf from Kuwait.       The State Department renewed its warning to Americans not   to travel to Iran because of what spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley   called, "its virulent anti-American policies and support for   terrorism."       "The threat to Americans has increased significantly," she   said in announcing that the department was reiterating advice   it last made in January. The department said about 2,600   American citizens live in Iran, the overwhelming majority dual   nationalities.       Oakley said no specific warning has been issued to U.S.   diplomats and Americans living abroad in the aftermath of the   U.S. attack on the oil drilling platforms, but "many of our   missions are on a high state of alert."
trade	BRAZIL'S SEPT TRADE SURPLUS HIGHEST OF THE YEAR   Brazil's September trade surplus   was the best so far this year, totalling 1.494 billion dlrs,   compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in   September last year, Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department   (Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference.       September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down   from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted   to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.       Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period   was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a   similar 1986 period.       Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222   mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said.       The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade   surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months   of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach   10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and   15.4 billion dlrs of imports.       He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured   and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which   accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept   period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.

interest:money-fx	TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP   As official Washington sought to   restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street   collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from   critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.       Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for   boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an   international accord to stabilize currency values.       Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was   among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped   spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors   think that a clash between the two major economic powers would   damage the world economy.       Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, "I   think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I   think, was partly due to statements that have been made by   senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic." It was a   dispute that should never have happened, he added.       Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a   hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he     still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United   States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to   Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.       Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, "His   timing could not have been worse."       One government bond salesman in New York said, "He actually   thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack   the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much   understanding of international monetary gamesmanship."       However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march   toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.       "On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if   you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial   markets), it was West German policy," said Robert Brusca of   Nikko Securities International in New York.       "All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so   making him responsible for it was a little like killing the   messenger," he said.       After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments   made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together   in Paris in February, was still in effect.       Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be   a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to   the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash   wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.      Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about   Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the   global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest   rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.       He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th   month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic   expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge   market for debtor country exports.       Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried   that the Republican party might face next year's presidential   election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly   tarnished.       A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt   crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has   already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.       "There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the   economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around   quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and   eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,"   former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a   television interview.       In many ways, the official response was mild.       Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,   with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting   that he was "puzzled."       U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately   returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments   and, presumably, their political impact.       For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in   Washington will diminish because of the market fall.       Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because   of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd   Bentsen said with some irony, "Oh, I think it's much too late to   be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the   attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---   retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do   that."

crude:ship	CONVOY RUNS GULF GAUNTLET, OTHER SHIPS STAY CLEAR   A new convoy of tankers escorted by   American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards   Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being   blasted by U.S. Navy raiders.       Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well   clear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline   emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.       "I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared this   conflict will escalate," a top West German Foreign Ministry   official, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after a   tour of three Gulf states.   b       Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea   captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S.   Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the   Gulf.       Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf   would stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S.   Action.       But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat   assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the   area.       Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S.   Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.       For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that   it was ready for any further hostile action.       Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided   missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying   the U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier   Ocean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.

trade	U.S. MAY END ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN   The United States may lift an   additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later   this month, Reagan Administration officials said.       President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on   Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986   agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third   country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.       The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on   Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and   portable computers.       Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after   Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at   below production costs.       Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory   and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.       The Administration officials said Commerce Department    monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the   semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking   sales away from American-made semiconductors.       They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would   be lifted by the end of the month.       The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the   closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.       U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance   with the agreement earlier this week.       The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining   sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is   in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.
lumber	CANADIAN PACIFIC (CP) UNIT STUDIES PULP MILL   CIP Inc, wholly-owned by Canadian   Pacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas which   would use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president Cecil   Slenniken said in an interview.        The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and was   artificially developed several years ago. The plant, which has   been grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in   three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint   than wood pulp, a CIP official said.        Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a   200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but   would need partners to begin the project.       "We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of   dollars it would take for such a project," Slenniken said.        He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis to   make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct   softwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.       CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently   launched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,   British Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metric   tonnes per year by fall of 1989.

"The United States remains committed to the Louvre   agreement," Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with   his top economic advisers.       Reagan said the United States, Japan and West Germany had   all reaffirmed their commitment to coordinate economic   policies.       Reagan said Japanese Prime Minister-designate Noboru   Takeshita said in a telephone conversation Tuesday morning that   "his (Takeshita's) top priority was to maintain stable economic   relations with the United States."       Reagan noted that Treasury Secretary James Baker met with   West German financial officials and reaffirmed their commitment   to the Louvre agreement.       They "reaffirmed our agreement to coordinate economic   policies to provide for non-inflationary growth and stable   exchange rates," Reagan said.

"Southland has been advised that the Commission has issued   a private order of investigation concerning the trading of   Southland stock during various times in 1987 and the issuance   of various public statements by Southland," Southland said in a   proxy statement to shareholders.       Southland did not elaborate on the SEC order of   investigation, and company officials could not be reached for   comment late Tuesday.       The SEC has a long-standing policy against confirming or   denying the existence of investigations.       The proxy statement, filed with the Securities and Exchange   Commission, is required for a November 5 shareholders meeting   called to approve the previously announced acquisition of   Southland by a company controlled by Southland chairman John   Thompson and members of his family.       Earlier this year, a group led by Thompson acquired   majority ownership of Southland through a 77 dlrs a share   tender offer for 31.5 mln shares of Southland common stock.

crude:ship	SENATE BACKS U.S. RETALIATION IN GULF   The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed   President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets   in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy   in the volatile region.       Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed   Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in   retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship   flying the American flag.       The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.   resolve that Iran "cannot take military action against the   United States with impunity."       Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and   set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role   in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require   Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead   to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.       While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.   retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing   U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan   comply with the War Powers Act.
trade	CANADA SEEKS FIVE YEAR FARM REFORM PLAN   Canada will propose at the new round of   international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm   subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister   Pat Carney said.       "Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a   vicious circle which continues to cause problems of   overproduction and low commodity prices," Carney told the House   of Commons.       Carney was outlining the government's new position on the   farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the   multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs   and Trade).       While few details were released, Carney said the government   would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and   new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial   barriers.       "Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to   ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the   specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," a   government background paper said.       "Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs,   credit could be given to countries which effectively control   the output of farm products," the papers said.

trade	US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE   Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter   said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada   and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the   global trading system.       He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back   worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs   and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.       The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay   to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it   trade in agriculture and services such as banking.       Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting   marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The   Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet   been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.       The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove   tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and   many services.       Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli   pacts "other countries have realized that if they want to   continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had   better get serious about improving the GATT."       The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing   shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially   increase the gross national products in both countries.       Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should   serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.       Yeutter said, "increasing trade is one of the keys to   enhanced political and economic stability around the globe."       He said, "a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only   for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries   that need to increase trade in order to better their standards   of living."       Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress   made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to   protectionism.       He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress   that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions   against nations with large trade surpluses with the United   States if the countries practiced unfair trade.       The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade   deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still   rising.       Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to   resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President   Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.       Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.       He said, "President Reagan will veto any bill that contains   serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."
dlr:money-fx	BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS   News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury   Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard   Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the   dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.       News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great   secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by   Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears   that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.       The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two   pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.       The announcement of the meeting, also attended by   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously   in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York   markets.       Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies   accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry   spokesman in Bonn said.       The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of   1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.       The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market   reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest   rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that   West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.       Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to   coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with   the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating   their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget   deficit.       West German government sources said rising West German   money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre   pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest   rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising   since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed   raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.       German yields have also risen over this period, but less   markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up   short-term rates by changing the terms on its security   repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the   money market.       The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,   compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's   inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,   but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the   Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary   growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,   bank economists said.       This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the   pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl   since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the   more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.       In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,   the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this   morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.   anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.       "They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much   under American fire," said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at   Swiss Bank Corp here.       "It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a   significant retreat from its position," added Giles Keating,   economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.       The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of   the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact   on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market   economists said.       Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank   does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation   rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,   little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.       The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication   that the meeting would take place, although the Finance   Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.       Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to   comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre   accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he   assumed monetary cooperation would continue.       The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West   Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit   Denmark and Belgium.
crude	EX-ARCO &lt;ARC> CHIEF SEES ENERGY CRISIS BY 1990   Dwindling global crude oil reserves and   the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send   the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic   Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.       "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Anderson   told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "I   believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in   two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find."       Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil   and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln   barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about   4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.       "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up   one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle   East," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where we   were in 1973 and 1979."       Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at   about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.       "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't   enough supply," he said. "There have been no major oil   discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years."       Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world   discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of   oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.
crude	VENEZUELA BACKS INCREASE IN ECUADOR OPEC QUOTA   Venezuela will back Ecuador's bid to   raise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd)   because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister   Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.       He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in   compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil   production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an   earthquake last March.       "For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its   right to produce 221,000 bpd," he said. "We should recognize   Ecuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of   justice in that country's petition."       He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to   avoid harming the market, he added.       Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would   formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next   ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum   Exporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna.

crude:ship	U.S., AT U.N., CLAIMS SELF-DEFENSE FOR GULF ATTACK   The United States invoked the right   of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the   Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations.       Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the   incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the   delegate of Italy, and Secretary General Javier Perez de   Cuellar.       U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary   General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal   last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued   efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq.       In his explanation, Walters said the United States took   defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against   American ships in the Gulf.       He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in   Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle   City.       Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian   platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United   States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes.       "In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations   (Charter), I wish, on behalf of my government, to report that   United States forces have exercised the inherent right of   self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action   in response to attacks by . . . Iran against United States   vessels in the Gulf," Walters said.       Members of the Security Council met behind closed doors on   Monday to discuss developments in the Gulf war, but no   statement was issued afterwards.
crude:ship	FRANCE SAYS U.S. HAD RIGHT TO STRIKE   France voiced its comprehension for a U.S.   Attack on an Iranian target while calling for a swift halt to   the Gulf War to avoid further escalation.       "The French authorities reaffirm their attachment to the   freedom and security of navigation and to the right of all   states to take action under international law and the United   Nations charter to halt attacks such as that of October 16," the   Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement.       The United States said its forces destroyed an Iranian oil   platform in the Gulf and struck at a second on Monday in   retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack on a   U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ship.       Washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping   and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping. The French   statement described the target as "an Iranian military platform."       But the French statement added that "everything must be done   now to avoid that these military developments lead to a new   escalation of the conflict."

crude:ship	U.S. LAWMAKERS SUPPORT GULF ACTION   American lawmakers rallied behind   President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in   the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress   debate over limits on his powers to make war.       The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships   destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf   ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second   Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on   a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.       Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans   expressed support for the attack and praised it as an   appropriate "measured response."       But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that   the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States   could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply   with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of   American forces from the waterway.       "Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize   their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war   with Iran," said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.

A statement issued after a cabinet meeting said Goria had   been informed by the United States that it would take action   against an Iranian target in the Gulf, but had not known   beforehand that the action would involve an attack on an oil   platform.       "The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible   consequences of increased tension in the Gulf, at the same time   recognizing the limited character of the American military   reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days,"   the statement said.       Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at   the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow   events with caution.       Italy has sent eight ships, including three frigates and   three minesweepers, to the Gulf to protect Italian merchant   shipping there.

After the meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as   saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be   stabilised at around current levels.

Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the   policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to   currency stability and monetary policy.       Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity into   the West German money market in a move which money market   dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetary   authority to curb interest rate rises.

coconut-oil:oilseed:palm-oil:palmkernel:soybean:veg-oil	US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT   A proposal to require imported   tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow   and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.       The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a   10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes   the plan would be adopted this year.       A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.       Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an   amendment to a farm spending reduction package.       "I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving   American consumers the information they need," he said.       Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean   Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils   are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.       The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating   tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage   consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,   Indonesia and the Philippines.       But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.   Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal   "blatantly discriminates" against imports, would be impossible to   defend under international trade law and would harm relations   with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.       Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their   saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively   little from tropical oils.       The committee voted largely along party lines, with three   Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.

crude	U.S. MILITARY LEADER PREDICTS IRANIAN RESPONSE   William Crowe, chairman of the U.S.   Joint Chiefs of Staff, predicted Iran will retaliate for the   U.S. strike against its oil platform though he said Iranian   options were limited.       "They will be determined. They will not be easily deterred,   and let me stress for you that our commitment there is not   going to be risk free or casualty free."       He said the most likely Iranian response would involve   terrorism or the laying of mines.       "They obviously will look for ways that are probably more in   line with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far,"   Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.       He declined comment on a reporter's query whether he   favored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by the   president.       "We carried out the operation that was decided upon and we   carried it out with enthusiasm and I think it was   professionally and well done," Crowe said.

crude:ship	U.S. FORCES DESTROYED OIL RIG, RAIDED ANOTHER   U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil   platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a   second oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile   attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.       President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger   warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military   escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile   waterway.       Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by   four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells   at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central   Gulf.       A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian   oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar   and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the   Pentagon said.        Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters   that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian   personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig.       The United States said both platforms were being used to   keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat   attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards.

trade	EC, U.S. PLAN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS   The European Community is willing to   offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two   major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations   next year, an EC commission spokesman said.       He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this   month between U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC   External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq.       EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture   ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make   some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on U.S.   Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed   with growth hormones, the spokesman said.       Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC   proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries   do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the   makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming U.S.   Manufacturers.       It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will   rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year.       Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will   take place in London and will also involve the aerospace   ministers of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain, the   countries involved in the Airbus project.
crude:ship	BRITAIN BACKS U.S. STRIKE ON IRAN OIL PLATFORM   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey   Howe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil   platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf   crisis.       "The United States is fully entitled to take military action   in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the   imminent threat of further attacks," Howe said in a statement   issued in London.       The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on   Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-   flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.       Referring to that attack, Howe added, "I trust the Iranians   will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will   only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense."       At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of   European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about   statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was   now involved in a full-scale war.       "It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified   for Iran to react in that way," he said.

crude:ship	HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS   Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like   beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.       One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,   was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.       The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and   concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60   metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.   Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.       The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section   of the structure remained.       U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an   American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.   forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had   been caught laying mines.       But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense   officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm   missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday   and the Sea Isle City on Friday.       Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a   key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.       Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East   now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti   tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.       But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level   of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result   of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.       The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a   U.S. "tit-for-tat" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said   Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.       He said with this appraoch America would suffer "the death   of one thousand cuts."       But for the United States to grab the initiative   militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's   harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its   shipping must pass, Schuler said.       He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing   Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,   Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.       Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic   initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an   arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.       He said the United States should also threaten to mine and   blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to   acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a   settlement.       Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by   invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the   outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style   infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.       Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

crude:ship	DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED   A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform   in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid   carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab   allies, Western diplomats in the region said.       U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that   U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf   in response to a missile strike on the American-registered   Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.       "We consider the matter closed," he said, a signal the U.S.   administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.       Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day   against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action   would endanger American interests.       Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War   Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a   "crushing blow."       "The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in   no way get out safely," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.       Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid   ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on   November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.       Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in   Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in   preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.       Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab   states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they   said.       "The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to   respond one way or the other," a diplomat said.       President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American   countermeasures if the military escalation continued.       Western diplomats and military sources in the area said   shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act   the United States could have taken once it had decided to   retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans   and Kuwaitis on Iran.       "It's interesting that they chose something in international   waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation," one   diplomat said. "This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf   Arab states, particularly Kuwait."       Commented another diplomat: "Kuwait must be happy that the   U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked   on its doorstep."       One source said of the attack on the oil platform: "They   managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the   least nuisance to everybody."       A diplomat commented: "They were very clever in the place   they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated   anything because it wasn't working in the first place."       A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:   "This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up   ... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans)."

crude:ship	LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US   Military experts say the United States   faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an   Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a   U.S.-flagged tanker.       The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is   likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as   long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching   limited retaliatory strikes.       But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps   -- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or   destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.       "Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the   cycle of attack and retaliation continues," said Fred Axelgard,   a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and   International Studies (CSIS).       "It's like a Greek tragedy," said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll   of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)   think tank.       Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for   Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to   the war between Iran and Iraq.       They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its   30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began   escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal    would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which   President Reagan could never accept.       U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon   news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel   fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam   oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf   time (0700 EDT) on Monday.       Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military   base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian   Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea   Isle City on Friday.       Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and   allowed to escape.       "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will   be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran   with stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.       "We consider this matter closed," he said.       Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives   agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not   escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was   whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken   this view after earlier clashes.

The company said that in the event of certain triggering   events described in the rights plan, holders of the rights,   other than an acquiring person, will be entitled to acquire   Northeast's common shares having a market value of twice the   then-current exercise price of the rights. Also, in the event   Northeast enters into certain business combination   transactions, holders of the rights will be provided a right to   acquire equity securities of the acquiring entity having a   market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the   rights, the company said. Northeast said it will be entitled to   redeem the rights at one cent per right until the occurence of   certain events.
oilseed:soybean	U.S. DRAFTS SANCTIONS IN ARGENTINA SOY CASE   The U.S. is drafting options including   possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over   the differential between soybean and product  taxes which   Buenos Aires levies on exports.       The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure   of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed   by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.   officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential   export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in   competition with the U.S.       "Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict   (Argentine) access to our market," said one U.S. source.             The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after   Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to   end the differential.       But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88   year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.       Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture   minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille   on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not   narrow the differential further for 1987/88.       As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering   restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef   and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.       A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan   administration soon, they said.

The September surplus compared with a shortfall of 1,697   billion lire in September 1986. For the first nine months of   1987, the overall balance of payments showed a deficit of 1,921   billion lire against a 1,725 billion deficit in the same 1986   period.       The central bank said Italy's one billion dlr Eurobond   launched last month contributed to September's surplus.

grain	SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT   Recent announcements from Moscow of   next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets   are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,   Agriculture Department analysts said.       USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but   some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987   grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.       Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,   putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of   Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in   Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be   "25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year."       "This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213   mln tonne (grain) crop," the analyst said.             In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235   mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure   published in a Soviet economic journal this month.       USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a   range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.       Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest   progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.       While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture   official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be   as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.       A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln   tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would   bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.

"The Louvre Accord has worked very well in terms of   stabilizing exchange rates," he said in response to a question   during an American Stock Exchange conference here.

M.A. Hanna said the purchase, which is subject to certain   conditions, is scheduled to close around the end of October.   Hanna announced last August that it was in negotiaitons to   purchase the company.       Headquartered in Somerset, N.J., PMS reported over 70 mln   dlrs in revenues in its last fiscal year, which ended May 1987.
cpi	FED'S JOHNSON SEES EASING OF INFLATIONARY FEARS   Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman   Manuel Johnson said the inflationary expectations in the   financial markets have eased since the Fed's last half-point   increase in its discount rate to 6.0 pct.       "We have seen the kind of expectational forces develop I   think that we've been satisfied with since our last discount   rate move," Johnson said.       Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the most recent   discount rate increase on September 4 was largely aimed at   quelling inflationary fears in financial markets which he said   were largely unfounded.
crude	AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT   Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on   world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains   that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the   Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.       December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before   falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.       "Fundamentals are awful," said Philip Lambert, analyst with   stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC   production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln   bpd, little changed from September levels.       Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC   production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and   International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September   production at 18.5 mln bpd.       The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of   a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea   Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,   in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag   commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.       The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the   area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.       Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on   Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.   Attack, analysts said.       They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which   around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in   the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.       Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in   the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf   hostilities, analysts said.       But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian   missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.       Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,   said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.       "The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond   to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any   further action will be met with a like-for-like response.   Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory," Pyne said.       Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was "a   responsible retaliation," with the U.S. Apparently indicating to   Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran   chose to raise the level of conflict.       Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.       He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as   Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests   the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a   result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian   retaliation.       The initial upward market move this morning reflected a   strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which   was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile   launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.       The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy   attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary   Caspar Weinburger.       Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the   Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less   serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,   analysts and traders said.

It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying, "We will   definitely retaliate and will not leave this American move   unanswered."       A broadcast monitored in Nicosia said several civilian   personnel on the Rashadat oil platforms in the Gulf east of   Qatar were injured when U.S. Warships bombarded them this   afternoon. It described damage as "severe."       Washington said four American frigates shelled and   destroyed two Iranian platforms at the Rashadat (formerly   Rostam) field at 1100 GMT on Monday in response to Friday's   missile attack on a U.S.-flag ship in Kuwaiti waters.       The U.S. Said Iranians used the platforms for military   pruposes and had fired on an American helicopter from the rigs   earlier this month.

dlr:money-fx	FED'S JOHNSON WARNS AGAINST LOWER DOLLAR   Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman   Manuel Johnson cautioned against seeking "quick-fix solutions" to   persistent U.S. trade and federal budget deficits.       In particular, he told an American Stock Exchange   conference, a decline in the dollar below current levels would   exacerbate financial market conditions.       "Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely below   current levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditions   and lead to further potential for financial problems."       Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S.   businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates.       He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persisting   despite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in the   past two years.       But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soon   begin showing improvement.       "The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructive   expansion without inflationary instability," he said.

crude	SECURITY COUNCIL CALLS TALKS AFTER GULF ATTACK   The U.N. Security Council was   called to a private meeting on Monday for consultations    following the United States attack on an Iranian oil platform.       Meanwhile, a U.N. spokesman said that as far as he knew a   report to the council and Secretary General Javier Perez de   Cuellar on the action had not been received from the Americans.       In Washington, President Reagan said the United Nations was   being informed of the attack under the provision of the U.N.   Charter regarding notification of actions taken under the right   of self-defense.       The U.N. spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said Perez de   Cuellar had no comment on the attack, taken in response to   Iranian action against an American-owned tanker last week, but   was trying to find out "what actually happened."       Calls to Iran's U.N. commission elicited no response.

acq	BARING UNIT SETS UP FUND FOR MANAGEMENT BUY-OUTS   Baring Capital Investors Ltd (BCI), a unit   of the U.K. Merchant bank &lt;Baring Brothers and Co Ltd>, said it   has raised 61 mln European Currency Units (ECUs) which will be   invested in management buy-outs and development capital   opportunities in the U.K. And continental Europe.       The funds were raised through BCI's first such fund - the   Baring Euaring European Capital Trust - from investors in nine   European countries. It expects to raise another 40 mln ECUs   soon through a French fund and a fund for U.S. Investors.       BCI was set up last year by Baring Brothers to advise   buy-out and development capital investors.       BCI said the new fund is structured as a Guernsey-based   unit trust, which will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock   Exchange. It will be advised by BCI and managed by a company   owned jointly by Barings and the management of BCI.       Individual investments are expected to range between one   and 10 mln ECUs and are likely to be concentrated in the U.K.,   Germany and France.       BCI said its aims are to invest in established companies,   principally family companies with succession-issues and   corporate spin-offs.
money-fx	G-7 SEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP CURRENCY PACT   International monetary officials will    rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the   Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar   free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,   economists and currency traders said.       "I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up   in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the   dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.   It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,"   said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.             In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary   James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German   money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to   foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.       His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send   the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a   tailspin.       The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about   1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen. The Dow   Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at one   stage and U.S. Treasury bonds dropped about 1-3/4 points.

The board also said it will ask representatives of the   Committee to Restore Shareholder value to begin acquainting   themselves with the business and affairs of the company as   promptly as possible.             To that end, the committee's representatives will be   invited in advance of the annual meeting to examine the   company's financial records, to monitor its operations and to   join company officers in meetings with the company's suppliers,   bankers and key personnel, Crazy Eddie said.       The board said that to continue to oppose the EMI-Palmieri   group would only increase the expenses of the company, create   further uncertainty among its suppliers, customers and   employees, and result in deterioration of moral among company   personnel.

corn:grain:wheat	SENATE PANEL STUDIES LOAN RATE, SET ASIDE PLANS   The Senate Agriculture Committee was   expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in   county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and   wheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said.       A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy   (D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate   differentials to no more than one pct per year from the   national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.       The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to   increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by   "an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected corn   stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels.       Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set   aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels.

money-fx	TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS   The Louvre accord on currency stability,   which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since   last February, appeared in serious danger today as a   transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to   the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.       But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and   bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial   countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem   between the United States and West Germany and insisted that   the currency pact was still alive.       U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market   fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term   interest rates. "That's not in keeping with the spirit of what   we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,"   Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was   referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group   of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the   pact.       Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both   have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic   growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.   Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.       However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre   agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate   move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.       "The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that   he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets   are off in terms of currency cooperation," Chris Johns, currency   analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.       But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine   view, telling Reuters that "the exchange market is apparently   reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker   comment will regret it later on."       French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the   Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to   respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for "a faithful   and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the   Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."       Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British   Treasury commented on the row.       But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite   U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, "this does   not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the   Louvre Accord."       In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive   of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that   following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.   Was still committed to the accord.       In a move which the market interpreted as a possible   gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term   liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on   Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected   medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also   stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,   injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose   close to eight pct.

A bid for control of Media General would be subject to "a   recapitalization or possible restructuring and to possible   changes in the charter documents and by-laws of the company,"   it said.       The group said it had held discussions with third parties   to gauge their interest in joining the shareholder group, but   no agreements were reached.       Talks with third parties are expected to continue, the   shareholder group said.

gold	SWEDEN'S BOLIDEN TO OPEN SAUDI ARABIAN GOLD MINE   Mining group Boliden AB said it had   agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral   Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to   exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.       Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish   group would  be responsible for the technical side of the   operation and would have no control over the product itself.       He said one option under discussion for refining the gold   ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in   northern Sweden.       Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it   was strategically important since it increased Boliden's   presence in Saudi Arabia.       "Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar   already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the   future," he said.       The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab   in the west of the country and should open in the first half of   1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold   smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.       Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi   Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to   open in modern times.       "This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of mining   technology and knowhow," said the group's chief executive, Kjell   Nilsson.

sugar	UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET   British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its   Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute   shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a   Reuter inquiry       Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination   of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the   factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's   hurricane which blocked roads.       The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are   cleared and supplies of beet build up again.       This is the first time in many years that a factory has   been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.       Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,   but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.       Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British   Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year   out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.       Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting   problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining   its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2   mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the   spokesman said.       British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.       The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,   is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories   normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the   campaign.       As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been   harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13   pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has   severely restricted beet lifting.       Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet   available.

acq	MULTIFOODS &lt;IMC> FILES SUIT AGAINST BREGMAN   International Multifoods Corp   said it filed a suit charging Bregman Partners and its   affiliates unlawfully planned to acquire control of the   company.       In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International   Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who   reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to   induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take   the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman   Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the   Belzberg families of Canada.       The complaint also discloses that on each occasion,   Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures.       Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares   in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the   market place, according to the suit. The suit seeks   compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be   determined.       In addition, Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners   from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it   reportedly owns, the suit said.       According to Multifoods, the actions proposed by Bregman   Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full   benefits of the company's restructuring.       In the past three years, Multifoods has substantially   altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S.   consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected   segments of the U.S. foodservice industry.

carcass:hog:livestock	STUDY SAYS PORK LEANER THAN USDA FIGURES SHOW   An Iowa State University study showed   pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by   long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the   National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.       Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study   averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart   Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all   the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained   less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.       Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the   established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat   content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.       Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs   for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy   between the study and the USDA handbook.       "Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information   that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The   statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today   which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,   thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,"   Kline said.       The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,   evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories   from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat   content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,   moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.
gnp:grain:ipi	SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS   The Soviet Union outlined its economic   targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve   standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.       Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet   industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a   planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.       Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent   to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a   planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the   output of a country's goods and services.       He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of   grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow   produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.       Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described   machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is   essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on   world markets.       "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the   machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a   considerable amount of the equipment that it requires," said   Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.       Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes   machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,   increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987   compared with the same period last year.       However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned   for the industry for the whole of 1988.       Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent   meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to   a large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scale   measures are planned to save resources," he said.       Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that   defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same   figure as was announced last year.       Western governments view official Soviet estimates for   defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure   is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are   intertwined with the civilian economy.       Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending   next year on medical services, education, pensions and social   insurance schemes.
crude	TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM   The official Soviet news agency Tass   denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in   the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would   bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.       Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration   had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect   attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms   to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.       "The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that   the latest military adventure will not bring political   dividends to the American administration," Krutikhin said.       Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard   Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on   Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were   concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.       Soviet officials have previously criticized the United   States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their   presence serves to increase tension.       Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and   Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought   broader contacts with Iran in the last year.       Krutikhin said: "The United States has undertaken an act of   armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has   long been spoken of by Washington officials."
ship	WORLD TELECOMS WATCHDOG RELAXES CAR PHONE RULES   The International Telecommunications   Union, which regulates communications worldwide, decided at the   end of a five-week conference to allow mobile phone systems to   be linked with satellites, telecommunications officials said.       Until now, car phones have been linked with land stations   and have been limited mainly to urban areas. The new ruling   will make it easier for calls to be made from remote regions.       The meeting, which finished over the weekend, also decided   to allow a "radio determination satellite system," which would   enable fleet owners to trace to within about 15 metres the   movements of their lorries or cars or ships around the world.

The company said the offer is being made under a definitive   agreement reached with the new company, IDC Acquisition Corp,   formed by Apollo Partners Ltd and investment clients of   &lt;Equitable Capital Management Inc>. The agreement calls for the   acquisition of IDC for about 62.4 mln dlrs.       IDC Acquisition will also tender for all of IDC's   outstanding nine pct convertible subordinated debentures.             IDC said the merger agreement also provides for payment of   an equivalent amount in respect of employee stock options to be   cancelled in the merger.       As part of the transaction, the company said, it granted   IDC Acquisition an option to acquire up to 20 pct of the   company's outstanding shares for 16 dlrs per share.       It said the planned tender offer is subject to several   conditions, including the tendering of over 50 pct of the   company's outstanding stock.             MIM Holdings Ltd &lt;MIMA.S>, a substantial shareholder in   IDC, has agreed it will not buy any additional IDC shares until   February seven and has granted IDC Acquisition a right of first   refusal on any IDC shares it sells during that period, the   company said.

acq	IC INDUSTRIES &lt;ICX> MAY SELL AEROSPACE UNIT   IC Industries Inc said its board approved   a second major step in the reorganization and restructuring of   the company.       To implement the plan of sharpening its strategic focus on   consumer goods and services, the company will give serious   consideration to the sale of its Pneumo Abex, its aerospace and   defense company, if it can realize a price which will return   maximum value to shareholders.       In 1986, Pneumo Abex had operating income of 118.1 mln dlrs   on sales of 900.5 mln dlrs.       IC said it will use the proceeds of any asset sale to   invest in new high-return businesses in the consumer goods and   services field.       The company said it authorized a program to repurchase   between 500 mln dlrs and 1.0 billion dlrs of IC's common stock   from time to time when conditions warrant.       It also said it will begin an immediate cost-reduction   program to cust annual operating expenses by 50 mln dlrs.       An IC spokesman said the cost-reduction program involved   "across-the-board" cuts rather than specific about targeted   areas.       IC's board earlier approved a plan to spin off the   company's Illinois Central Gulf Railroad to shareholders. The   company's other major subsidiaries are Pet Inc, Pepsi-Cola   General Bottlers, Midas International Corp and Hussmann Corp.

Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major   agricultural producers, to which Australia and Thailand belong,   has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral   trade talks. "There's no doubt that the Cairns Group is being   seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the   General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other   international trade negotiations," he said.       Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United   States, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, said   considerable progress has been made by the group towards   fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed   countries.       The minister said the EC Commission's new farm trade paper   will recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its   Common Agricultural Policy and its future expansion.       He said the Reagan Administration has also displayed a   determination to resist the currently strong protectionist   sentiment in the U.S. Congress.

The cumulative trade position in July showed a 1.85 billion   dlr deficit after 1.33 billion in June and 1.89 billion a year   earlier, with exports at 4.91 billion and imports, both FOB, at   6.76 billion.       The government aims to narrow the current account deficit   for the whole of 1987 to 975 mln dlrs, compared with 1.52   billion last year, up from 1.01 billion in 1985.       Bankers forecast the 1987 deficit will exceed one billion   dlrs,  because a spurt in exports is expected to slow   considerably in the last five months following a massive   drawdown of inventories.

ipi	SOVIET UNION SETS 4.5 PCT INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT GROWTH   Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told   the Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned to   rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.       In the first nine months of this year, industrial output   rose by 3.6 pct.       Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent   to gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct   against a planned 4.1 pct this year.       He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in   1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.       The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986   and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the   harvest this year.       Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering   industry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described   as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the   Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets.       "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the   machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a   considerable amount of the equipment that it requires," said   Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.       Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes   machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,   increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this   year against the same period of 1986. This is well below the   7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.       Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent   meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to   a large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scale   measures are planned to save resources," he said.       Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet   defence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the   same as announced last year.       Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increase   spending next year on medical services, education, pensions and   social insurance schemes       He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171   billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than had   originally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan.

crude:ship	U.S. NAVAL FORCES ATTACK IRANIAN OIL PLATFORM   U.S. warships attacked and destroyed   an Iranian oil platform on Monday in retaliation for Friday's   Iranian attack damaging a U.S.-flagged ship, U.S. Defense   Secretary Caspar Weinberger said.       When asked how much was left of the oil platform,   Weinberger said, "Nothing."       "There was no Iranian reaction," he said. "... We consider   this matter is now closed."       Weinberger said four U.S. destroyers attacked the platform   about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire   at 0700 EDT, Weinberger said.       "We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with   and be a source of potential attack on convoys...," Weinberger   said at a Pentagon briefing.        "We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small   boat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters...       "It's removal will contribute significantly to the safety of   U.S. forces in the future," Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy's   operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf.       "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will   be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran   with stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.       He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform   were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.       "As far as we know they did abandon the site," he said.       Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to   attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile   platforms blamed by Washington for Friday's attack.

On September 8, the group offered 64.00 dlrs in cash and   2.50 dlrs principal amount of 15 pct junior subordinated   debentures due 2007 for each GAF share.  Heyman owns about   2,700,000 of GAF's 33.5 mln shares outstanding.       In a letter to the committee of independent directors   formed to consider the offer, Heyman said it will have to   modify the terms of the offer if it is to continue the bid, due   to rising interest rates and financial market conditions.       Heyman said "In the considerable time that has elapsed   since our original proposal was submitted, the credit and   financial markets have experienced extraordinary and almost   unprecedented deterioration.  As of the present time, the   average interest rate on the financing which we proposed to   raise in connection with the acquisition has increased, since   the original proposal, by approximately 150 basis points."       He said the group intends to promptly review all available   options, including the revision of its offer to reflect current   market conditions.
bop	S.KOREA CURRENT A/C SURPLUS SEEN NEAR 10 BLN DLRS   South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,   said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billion   dlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for the   country's cheap cars and electronic goods.       Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the   Yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own   figures later in the week.       Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current   account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled   7.03 billion dlrs.       This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the   whole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with   the International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid   revaluation of the won against the dollar.       The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,   up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.       "Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many   public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will   be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten," Yonhap said.       The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a   resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous   month.       More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,   electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest   between July and September.       The South Korean government originally targeted a five   billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise   this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export   boom.       If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus   seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United   States which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with   Seoul last year, government economists said.       The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressure   at home, has called on South Korea to open more markets to   American goods and revalue the won faster.       The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,   representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year.

crude:ship	AIRCRAFT ATTACK IRANIAN OIL RIGS IN SOUTHERN GULF   Unidentified jets attacked three Iranian   oil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday, setting at least   one of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said.       Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had   reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike   against Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oil   drilling platforms and setting them ablaze.       The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh   offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a   wave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up from   the Rostam field soon after.       At least one of the other two targets was also believed to   be ablaze, the sources said.       The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi   air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any   southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.       Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran   used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and   later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.       U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday   when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a   U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had   already made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran   attack but would not say what the decision was.

propane:ship	SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN   Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key   supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least   the next five years, oil industry sources said.       Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and   butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi   Arabian LPG, the sources said.       They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate   of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. "Saudi   is a reliable supplier in that sense," said one trader.       Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.       No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an   LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.       "Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,   which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf   could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities   in that area," said another trader.       Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20   pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at   Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to   contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from   other ports.       Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude   rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG   supply disruptions, traders said.       They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was   unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.       Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly   rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a   moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.       Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift   slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from   Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.       The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in   large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian   LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the   year ended March 1987, the sources said.       But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down   term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on   the spot market, they said.       Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which   5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term   contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of   Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.       Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made   some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the   recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the   Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.       The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been   unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to   replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.       Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by   Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87   pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)   of Arabian Light.       Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings   should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian   Light's GSP.       Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the   95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,   the trade sources said.       Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying   up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to   seller-buyer agreement.       Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut   supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.       "If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable   basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct," said   an official at a major importer. "Freight costs are higher for   cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a   longer haul and war risk insurance payments."       Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to   finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on   contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to   current levels, the sources said. "When we talk business, we   would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of   high dependence on a single supplier," said one.

crude:ship	NBC NEWS SAYS U.S. HAS RETALIATED AGAINST IRAN   U.S. television networks said on   Monday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike against   Iran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil   drilling platforms.       NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulled   from the sea.       It said cautiously that U.S. forces attacked late Sunday   and that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablaze   as a result, but CBS News and other networks said flatly that   U.S. forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms.       U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Friday   when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a   U.S.-flagged ship.       President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a   decision on the U.S. response to Friday's Iran attack but would   not say what the decision was.       Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the   attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was   almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.

oilseed:veg-oil	INDIAN RESERVE BANK TIGHTENS CREDIT POLICY   The Reserve Bank of India said it was   tightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raising   their cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective from   October 24.       The move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank's   policy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March and   is aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity.       The central bank also put selective controls on bank   advances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades.       "The policy's main objective is to fully meet the credit   requirements of agriculture, industry and exports, while   preventing excessive monetary expansion," bank Governor R.N.   Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks.       Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be kept   under control in the second half of the current financial year.       Bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first six   months of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the same   period last year, according to the bank.       Bankers said the bank's move to raise the cash reserve   ratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupees   from the banking system. Banks' total deposits are estimated at   around 1,000 billion rupees.       They said banks are under pressure because of low returns   on commercial lending and investments in government securities.       "Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintain   their statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and are   resorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings," said one banker.

MEES said government approval for the export pipeline   followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the   Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line       The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly   finished and construction is expected to start early next year,   the industry newsletter said.

interest:money-fx	GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION   Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's   central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are   normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the   central bank's independence.       But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,   president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a   controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of   the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.       Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last   Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and   interest rates       Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's   criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place   for foreign investors.       "The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and   Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign   investors," said one economist for a London broker, who asked   not to be identified.       Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial   policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to   steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.       "There are plenty of objective pressures which will result   in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill   feeling," said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.       News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct   withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in   a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and   abroad.       Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the   finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the   Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting   details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.       Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under   extraordinary pressures lately.       Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his   deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight   inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had   pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.       In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like   Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been   warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply   growth would eventually lead to rising prices.       Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank   council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his   views, bankers said.       "Poehl is in a minority in his own house," said Commerzbank's   Pfister.       "Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not   entirely his own," said another economist.       The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,   they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark   and hurting West German exporters.       The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the   Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.       Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James   Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.       Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986   war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.   Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to   stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.       One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round   of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.       But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for   Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.       The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted   most popular government politician last year, had to face   resistance from local barons in the government coalition   parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.       The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising   4.3 billion marks.       But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will   push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the   government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.       Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row   which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.       Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last   month early to sort out a row in the northern state of   Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.       The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after   allegations of a "dirty tricks" election campaign led to heavy   losses for the CDU in state elections.       Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last   weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.       Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more   remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and   was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.       When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this   year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government   gave Poehl another eight-year term.       Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he   hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.       But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was   not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the   Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West   German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.          The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called   for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged   dollar slide.       The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance   Ministers in Washington last month.       But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate   rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to."       "What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to   simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their   part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow   them," he added.

bop:gnp:jobs	HIGHER SPENDING EXPECTED IN MALAYSIA'S 1988 BUDGET   Malaysia's recovery from the worst   recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the   government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988   after seven years of austerity, economists said.       "Our country is walking on one leg now," said Ismail Salleh,   an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International   Studies. "It has to depend on public sector investment for   faster growth if the private sector is not moving."       Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking   one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.       The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under   two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct   because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.   Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and   semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.       The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion   ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.       Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct   in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.       Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen   blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.       One businessman said too many politicians give the   impression that Malaysia was unstable.       "If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential   to recover strongly is great," a banker said.       Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the   black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit   surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.       The government has said its fiscal policies will balance   the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.       The government will also repay some of its external debt,   which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.       Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt   ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential   goods are unlikely to change.       Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the   corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to   compete for investors with neighbouring states.

The harvest will be China's second highest in history but   poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers   have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.       Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln   tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.       Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln   tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09   mln in the same 1986 period.       Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices   for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase   the incentive for grain production.       China could not afford to become a major food importer, he   said.       The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's   1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390   mln tonnes.
cpi	PHILIPPINE INFLATION PREDICTED TO RISE   The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will   rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government   implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10   pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,   Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.       The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily   pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight   pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average   higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.       The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the   Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).       The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation   rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4   pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita   said. Both were proposed last month.       Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct   by the National Economic and Development Authority early this   month.       In the first three months of the year, inflation was a   negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5   and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics   Office said.       The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct   in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September   respectively, the National Statistics Office said.       It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water   prices.       The government's six and eight peso wage increases would   displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number   of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.
money-fx:rand	VOLKSKAS BANK SEES RAND HINGING ON INFLATION RATE   South Africa must drive down its   inflation rate to much lower levels to prevent a further   decline in the rand, said Volkskas Bank in its monthly economic   review.       The bank said that without a major drop in the inflation   rate, the rand was bound to eventually decrease even more,   regardless of a sharp rise in the gold price.       Inflation is running at an annual rate of some 17 pct and   the rand is around 49.53 U.S. Cents. Most economists estimate   continued high inflation.       Volkskas predicted the rand will remain fairly steady for   the rest of 1987 and then ease slightly next year.
sugar	SOVIET SUGAR CONSUMPTION UP AS HOME BREWING GROWS   A sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption   since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates   home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost   vodka sales, Pravda said.       The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had   increased by one mln tonnes a year, enough to be turned into   two billion bottles of moonshine.       At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle, it said,   this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the   equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year, or annual revenues   from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree.       "Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of   vodka, but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count   home-brew," Pravda said.       "The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also   firmly settled into cities, where the availability of natural   gas, running water and privacy has made it much easier."       Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol   campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first   step to improving Soviet economic performance, which had been   seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population.

money-fx	BANKS EXTEND TRADING HALT IN LEBANESE POUND   Lebanon's Bankers Association said it   extended its suspension of trading in the Lebanese pound for   two more working days to study ways to stem the currency's   collapse.       The Central Bank did not post the rate of the pound to the   dollar and other currencies on Monday. The pound closed on   Thursday at 407.00/412.00 to the dollar compared with   Wednesday's close of 384.00/386.00.       Association sources told Reuters Friday's suspension of   trading for two working days was continued on Monday for two   more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the pound.       The Association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in   east and west Beirut, halted trading on Friday in a chaotic   market after the pound crashed to four record lows in the week.       The pound, hit by the inability of Lebanon's religiously   and ideologically divided government to end 12 years of civil   war, has lost more than 80 pct of its international value this   year.
crude	STATOIL PLACES NORTH SEA VESLEFRIKK FIELD ORDERS   Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil)   &lt;STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field,   has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion   crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a   statement.       Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier   A/S &lt;KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert   Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating   production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed   well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.       Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S   &lt;AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the   well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand   in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.       Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a   fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field   partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several   months earlier than previously planned.       Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln   barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km   west of Bergen.       Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,   including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output   is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.       Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg   field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas   will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from   Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.       Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55   pct share, &lt;Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), &lt;Deminex (Norge) A/S>   (13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S &lt;NHY.OL> (nine pct) and &lt;Svenska   Petroleum AB> (4.5 pct).
dlr:dmk:money-fx:yen	LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS   The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations   still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize   currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.       And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the   weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower   range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of   Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.       "The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and   anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it   later on," the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.       The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the   dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he   noted.       A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in   monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would   never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar   against the mark or the yen.       The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between   140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.       The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and   141.35 yen.       "Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher   interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this   does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework   of the Louvre accord," the Finance Ministry official said.       He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any   further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only   hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt   problem.       Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their   interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets   further, the monetary officials said.       Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined   to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further   decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary   expectations in the U.S.       "That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre   agreement is still operative," the senior ministry official   said.       Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that   Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West   Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.       The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.   Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar   decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,   try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the   accord, foreign exchange dealers said.       But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional   statement that "the Louvre agreement is still operative," and   this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the   dealers said.       Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in   Tokyo currency markets.       The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised   pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates   higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,   or international economic policy coordination.       The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,   France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's   economic policies and from time to time apply "peer pressure" to   persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,   they noted. "Without such a basic agreement of multilateral   surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German   policy so openly," the ministry official said.       The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy   should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy   coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse   of the Louvre agreement, the official said.       He also said Japan has not received any specific request   from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term   money rates have been edging higher.       "This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking   policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate   rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons," he   added.

money-fx	BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS   French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur   issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of   the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major   industrial countries.       Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury   Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at   the accords, said "I firmly desire a faithfull and firm   adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre   accords -- in both their letter and spirit."       On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West   German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.       The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called   for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged   dollar slide.       The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance   Ministers in Washington last month.       But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate   rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to."       "What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to   simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their   part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow   them," he added.
rubber	RUBBER STOCK MANAGER SAYS QUALITY ACCEPTABLE   International Rubber Organisation   (INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests had   shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, but   acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it.       "We have said all along that the rubber is holding up well   from a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored in   proper conditions does not deteriorate," he told Reuters in a   telephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber sold   since he entered the market in September would be discussed at   an INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.       Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in   buying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible   poor quality.       Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the   "may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's   five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October   16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock   was uppermost in consumers' minds.       "We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand   the Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubber   before they carry on buying," he said.       Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different   locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all   warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.       Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the   past week to 10 days and this could reflect a "wait and see   attitude" by buyers, he said.       "Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts   until they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,   they are likely to buy more." Hofmeister said he could reduce   the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest   but INRO did not want to depress prices artificially.       Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates   that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur   and New York since September.       But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have an   idea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall   had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.       The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne   buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Council   meeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday.       The current international rubber pact expires on October   22.       The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 and   Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during   the interim period.
money-fx:nzdlr	ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR   An income tax surcharge and capital   gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of   the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.       Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the   Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to   restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by   current government policies.       The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn   would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.   He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could   be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.       Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a   percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was   probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.       He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct   value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,   but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.   Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary   impact of a currency depreciation.       The government had failed to bring inflation down despite   lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.       New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to   end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.       The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation   policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and   insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss   said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt   and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.       "The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are   going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought   is soundly based -- primarily because the government's   macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful," Bayliss said.

It said exports in the eight-month period rose to 3.58   billion dlrs from 3.18 billion in 1986, while imports rose to   4.12 billion dlrs from 3.34 billion a year earlier.

sugar	NEW ZEALAND IMPOSES SANCTIONS AGAINST FIJI   New Zealand has imposed sanctions   against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to   a republic, acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said.       The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut   economic aid. New Zealand will also not renew an agreement   which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in   March. The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about   10 mln dlrs a year.       Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the   government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from   Suva for discussions about other possible measures.       "We won't be reacting further until these discussions with   the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held,"   Palmer said.       The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after   Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25.   Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn   back from declaring a republic.       Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from   Commonwealth leaders in Vancouver that Fiji's membership of the   Commonwealth had lapsed. Prime Minister David Lange is in   Hawaii on his way home from Vancouver.
coffee	UGANDA PLANS TO EXPORT ROASTED COFFEE TO EUROPE   Uganda plans to export roasted coffee to   Europe by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.       A.R. Sendi said on Sunday that Uganda's Ministry of   Industry supports his plan to build a factory to roast, grind   and pack local coffee for export. Construction will start in   December and the factory should be ready by next October.       He said the Marketing Ministry has authorised the Coffee   Marketing Board to supply his company &lt;Unipack> with 24,000   tonnes of beans a year for processing and export. Sendi also   told reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loan   from the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris.       Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, and   expects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.       Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefit   Uganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln   (60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under the   latest International Coffee Agreement.       In addition, the value of roasted coffee should be   substantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.       The U.S. Is the biggest buyer of Ugandan coffee, most of   which is used to produce instant coffee.
crude	IRAN, SOVIET UNION TO SWAP CRUDE, REFINED PRODUCTS   The Soviet Union has agreed to supply   Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels   per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.       IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza   Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the   agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed   during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet   Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.       Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility   studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in   southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.       Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of   its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.       Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet   Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he   left for Moscow.       Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf   war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined   products.       Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at   the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the   Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.

dlr:money-fx:yen	TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN   Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching   nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the   significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.       "The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is   considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the   currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,"   said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi   Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.       The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday   closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.       The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of   140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York   and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.       The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.   Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.       "The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish   sentiment after Baker's comments," said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He   said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among   the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the   Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.       The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day   drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness   in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.       Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he   strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest   rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience   with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord   due to their fears of increasing inflation.       Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary   pressures also slow domestic demand.       West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to   boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade   deficit, Tanaka said.       U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still   massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest   rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.       "Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations   coordinate dollar buying intervention," said Soichi Hirabayashi,   deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange   department.       The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally   considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.       "The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near   future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations   failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre   accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,"   Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low   as 135 yen soon.
ship	JAPAN/INDIA CONFERENCE CUTS GULF WAR RISK CHARGES   The Japan/India-Pakistan-Gulf/Japan   shipping conference said it would cut the extra risk insurance   surcharges on shipments to Iranian and Iraqi ports to a minimum   three pct from 4.5 pct on October 25.       It said surcharges on shipments of all break-bulk cargoes   to non-Iraqi Arab ports would be reduced to 3.0 pct from 4.5.       A conference spokesman declined to say why the move was   taken at a time of heightened tension in the Gulf.
ipi	SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987   The Soviet Union's industrial output is   growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade   has fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.       Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show   industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of   1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.       Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986   period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2   pct.       Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion   roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.       One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction   of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last   year's calculations of industrial output included all goods,   irrespective of quality.       Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader   Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special   inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below   standard.       Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were   rejected in the nine-month period.       The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more   than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000   people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,   Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.       The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the   economy has been an important part of the modernisation   campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the   setting up of small shops on a private basis.       Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months   against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.       But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity   figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in   the West, which measures worker output over a given period.       Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union   as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5   mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period   last year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against   194 roubles a year ago.
